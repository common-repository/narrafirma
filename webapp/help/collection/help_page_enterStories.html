<h1 class="page-title">Enter or import stories</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
You can use this NarraFirma page to enter stories using a form that looks exactly like the web form your participants use in a web-based story collection. 
You can also import stories from a CSV file.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a story collection, then click <b>Add Story</b>. In the window that appears, fill in the form just as 
if you were telling the story yourself. When you're done, click <b>Submit Survey</b>. If you want to 
check that your stories are being entered correctly, go to 
the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page and look for them.
</p>
<p>
You can use this page to import story data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file
(which usually comes from a spreadsheet). See below for formatting instructions.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Connections to other pages</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Using this page to enter stories requires that you previously created a 
<a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">story collection</a>, which must be associated with a previously created
<a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">story form</a>.
You cannot
<a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">review incoming stories</a> or 
<a href="help_page_browseGraphs.html">review graphs</a> until you have either entered some stories on this page,
imported some stories (again, using this page), or collected some stories over the internet.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
What is the correct format for importing stories?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>You can read all about importing stories and other data in the <a href="help_page_importGuide.html">Guide to importing data</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
How do I delete a story I entered wrongly?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma does not let you delete stories completely. 
This is to avoid accidentally deleting important information. However, you can
mark a story to be <em>ignored</em>, which means it won't show up
in any counts or graphs or reports. It won't be visible
anywhere but the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen. 
</p>
<p>
To mark a story to be ignored:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen.</li>
<li>Select (click on) the story you want to ignore.</li>
<li>Type something (anything) in the "Reason to ignore this story" box. For example, you might type "test story" or
"data entry error" or "response too incomplete to use."</li>
</ol>
<p>
A story with <em>any text</em> in the "Reason to ignore" field will be left out of all graphs and reports. 
(You can sort by the "Ignore" field on the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen 
to see the stories you have chosen to ignore and why.)
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
But what if I really need to delete a story? What if ignoring it isn't enough?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can permanently delete a story by exporting your story collection to CSV, removing the offending story row
 in a spreadsheet program, and importing the CSV file as a new story collection. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Can I combine web-based and off-line story collection?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. You can enable web collection (on the <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">Start story collection</a> page), 
then add more stories on this page. Both types of stories will intermingle in your story collection.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
If I combine web-based and off-line story collection, how can I tell which story came from where?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can add a question to your form that asks where the story came from. 
Participants can enter "web" and you can enter "off-line." 
Or you can add an annotation question that distinguishes 
between the types of story (see <a href="../catalysis/help_page_writeAnnotationsAboutStories.html">Write annotation questions</a>).
