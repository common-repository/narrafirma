<h1 class="page-title">Observe story sharing</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
	On this page you can get a little practice noticing what happens when people share stories
	(in your community or organization or just in general),
	then take some notes to capture what you noticed.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Find a few people who don't mind if you take notes or make a recording 
as you engage in a conversation. Sprinkle a few story-eliciting questions around
and see what happens. Later, review your notes. The questions on this page will help you think about what you observed.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Why should I do this?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
When you aim to help people share stories, it's a good idea to spend some time paying attention
to how they share stories already. If you've never done this before, it's helpful to 
watch <em>anybody</em> share stories &mdash; just to get more familiar with the flow of it.
If you already have a pretty good feeling for how this works in general,
you might want to get a better feel for how story sharing plays out
in the community or organization you want to focus on.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Will my project suffer if I don't do this?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Here's a test: <em>pretend</em> you listened to a story-sharing conversation
in your project's community or organization. Then look over the questions on this page.
Do you think you could answer the questions without having actually listened to such a conversation?
If so, you can probably skip this activity. If not,
you might want to get out there and listen to a conversation or two.
It will create a better foundation for your story listening and facilitation later on in the project.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Is it better to take notes or make a recording?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
That depends on you and on the people you are observing. 
Taking notes while keeping up with a conversation can be difficult.
On the other hand, people usually mind note-taking less than recording. 
On the third hand, you can hear things in a recording that you didn't notice at the time of the conversation. 
If you can, try it both ways and see what works better for you and your project.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
What if I listen to a conversation and I still can't answer the questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Try listening to a second conversation. Some groups don't share a lot of stories,
and you may have to spread a wider net to pick up on story sharing.
Another option is to be a bit more explicit in your attempts to get story sharing started. 
Ask people to help you out in doing some background research for your project.
