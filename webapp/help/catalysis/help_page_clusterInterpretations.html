<h1 class="page-title">Cluster interpretations and/or observations</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
On the
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">previous page</a>,
you made <strong>observations</strong> about patterns in your data.
For each observation, you entered multiple
<strong>interpretations</strong> about what that observation might mean
(to reasonable people who happen to disagree). 
</p>
<p>
On this page you can draw your observations and/or interpretations together
into <strong>meaningful clusters</strong>. Clustering creates a two-tiered structure
to your catalysis report. People will be able to look at your report
at a high level, then "drill down" to the details that
lie behind each cluster.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
First choose a catalysis report to work on. 
Then, for either interpretations of observations (or both), click the <b>Copy or update</b> button above the surface you want to work on.
Move the items around, placing like with like. 
</p>
<p>Shift-click to select multiple items. 
	You can also draw a "rubber band" box to select multiple items. Shift-drag to add more items to the selection. Click anywhere outside an item to deselect everything.
</p>
<p>
When you are satisfied
that all of your interpretations/observations are in groups that make sense,
name the groups. For each group, choose <b>Create new cluster name</b> from the list of things you can do (under the clustering space), 
then click <b>Do it</b>.
Type in a name and description, then click <b>OK</b>. Once you have named and described all of your clusters, you are ready to print
your catalysis report. <strong>Your cluster names will become the headings of your report.</strong>
</p>
<p>The headings in a catalysis report with clustered interpretations are called "perspectives." The headings in a report
	with clustered observations are called "themes."
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Connections to other pages</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
	In order to use this page, you must first
	create a catalysis report (on the <a href="help_page_startCatalysisReport.html">Start catalysis report</a> page)
	and add some observations and/or interpretations to it (on the <a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page).
	The way you cluster your observations and/or interpretations on this page will affect the
	way your catalysis report appears (on the <a href="help_page_printCatalysisReport.html">Print catalysis report</a> page).

</div>

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
What do the circle colors mean?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
	<li>Gray: an interpretation, or an observation with no strength value set</li>
	<li>Orange: an observation with a strength value set (the brighter the orange the stronger the observation)</li>
	<li>Blue: a cluster name</li>
	<li>White: an item or cluster you have hidden (it will not appear in your report)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Why do I see an interpretation on this page that I cannot see on the "Explore patterns" page?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	Your choice of graph types and questions at the top of the "Configure catalysis report" page has no effect on your printed report. 
	It only controls what you can see on the "Explore patterns" page. 
	<b>Every interpretation you write is automatically included in the catalysis report</b> - that is, unless it is associated with 
	an observation with a strength value you chose not to print.
</p>
<p>
	To exclude a <i>particular</i> interpretation from your report, 
	hide it in the relevant clustering space. In the space, select the interpretation circle, 
	pick "Show/hide selected item/cluster in report" from the list below the space, and click "Do it".
	Hidden interpretations (and observations and clusters) are drawn as white circles.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Should I cluster interpretations or observations?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>Perspectives and themes organize your catalysis report in different ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Perspectives - overall points of view
		<ul><li>Interpretations - what some people might think
			<ul><li>Observations - what those thoughts could be based on</li></ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Themes - overall trends
			<ul><li>Observations - patterns anyone can see
				<ul><li>Multiple interpretations - what each pattern means to people with different perspectives</li></ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
</ul>
<p>
Which cluster type you should use depends on how you are going to use the report and who is going to work with it. 
Clustering by interpretations gives strong attention to multiple points of view on the stories you collected.
If you are using the report in a facilitated workshop, and you want to challenge people to think differently, 
clustering by interpretation can be a great way to break down assumptions and get people thinking in new ways.
This can also be a useful method of organization when the topic is sensitive and people are likely to be wary of "scientific"
approaches to understanding it.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, a clustered-interpretations report is longer and somewhat more confusing, especially since observations are repeated 
after each interpretation they are connected to. 
</p>
<p>
If your ambitions are more modest, or if you think people will be less than enthusiastic about exploring multiple perspectives, 
or if you just have a lot of information for people to get through, you might want to group your report by clustering observations. People will
still see multiple interpretations for each observation, but they'll see them <em>after</em> the observation,
which might make them seem less "real" or important. (And that might bother some people.)
</p>
<p>
You don't have to choose only one form of clustering. You can cluster your observations
<em>and</em> your interpretations. Each type of clustering provides a different type of summary and a different type of insight.
By clustering both ways, you can print both types of report. Then you can use each report in a different situation, or for different
groups who want to work with the patterns differently.
