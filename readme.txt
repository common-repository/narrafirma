Participatory Narrative Inquiry in a box. Gather stories and make sense of challenges and opportunities in your community or organization.

== Description ==

NarraFirma is companion software to the textbook [Working with Stories in Your Community Or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry](http://www.workingwithstories.org).

Participatory narrative inquiry is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex patterns for better decision making. PNI focuses on the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the recounting and interpretation of lived experience.

= What is NarraFirma? =

* It's a checklist. NarraFirma provides practical guidance as you work, with questions for you to answer, recommendations based on the conditions you describe, activities that help you make decisions, and just-in-time advice.

* It's a journal. NarraFirma helps you keep careful records about what happened in your project, and it gives you places to reflect on what happened. This reminds you to keep learning as you work, and it helps you to document your project for future reference.

* It's a kiosk. NarraFirma helps you collect stories, on-line and/or off-line, based on question forms you design (with sample questions you can copy). Because story collection is integrated, there is no need to export or import data.

* It's a workstation. NarraFirma helps you explore and interpret patterns in your data (stories and answers to questions about stories), creating annotated visualizations you can use to make sense of the stories you collected.

= Why choose NarraFirma? =

* It's portable. You can install NarraFirma anywhere, as a WordPress plugin or a Node.js web application. Web hosting is inexpensive, popular, and well supported. You can also install NarraFirma on your local computer and use it off-line. (Whichever installation method you choose, we strongly suggest that you set up SSL security on your web site before collecting or entering confidential or important information. Many hosting providers can help you with this task.) 

* It's a team player. With NarraFirma your team can work on projects together in real time without having to hand files back and forth. You can plan your project, collect stories, discover patterns, and reflect on what you've learned - together.

* It's an open book. NarraFirma is open source software. So if you have a question about how something works, you can just look at the source code to find out. If you need the software to do something it can't do, you can add new functionality yourself or ask someone else to add it.

* It works in the real world. One NarraFirma installation supports multiple projects, forms, data sets, and reports. Why? Because real-life story projects are rarely simple or predictable. So go ahead and make a mess. NarraFirma is ready for it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I found out more about participatory narrative inquiry? =

Take a look at the book behind NarraFirma, [Working with Stories in Your Community Or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry](http://www.workingwithstories.org)

= What should I do if I find a bug? =

Tell us about it on the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/pdfernhout/narrafirma/issues).

= What about web security? =

We strongly suggest that you set up any web site on which you intend to install NarraFirma with SSL (secure sockets). Your hosting provider should be able to help you do that.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the main page of NarraFirma. The sections of the software (and the phases of PNI) are shown in the diagram. Clicking on any of these buttons  leads to that section.

2. This the main page for the NarraFirma planning section. Links to all the pages in that section are listed. You can enter reminders for any page; they show up on this page.

3. Here the NarraFirma user is describing the groups of people who will be participating in their project. Describing your groups helps you think about how you should collect stories and what you should do with them.

4. Here the NarraFirma user is doing a little sensemaking exercise based on some stories they told about what might happen when they do the project. Thinking in stories during project planning helps to make better decisions about how to carry out the project.

5. Here the NarraFirma user is deciding how they will collect stories. They are looking at recommendations the software is giving them based on the answers they gave to the questions about their participant groups (see screenshot 3). 

6. Here the NarraFirma user is creating questions they will ask people about their stories.

7. Here is the NarraFirma survey form participants see when they tell their stories (or NarraFirma users see when they enter the stories they collected off-line).

8. Here the NarraFirma user is looking at stories as they come in to the collection. They are looking here only at stories told by older people who said the person in their story wanted to be heard.

9. Here the user is looking at patterns in the data (answers to questions) collected. The selected row of the table of patterns (at the top) shows that the questions "How do you feel about this story" and "What is your age" are being compared, creating a contingency (bubble) graph. The user has written an observation about that pattern ("People under 35 more positive") and two interpretations of what that pattern might mean ("More weight on older shoulders" versus "Younger people have lots of energy"). The user has selected some stories on the graph to read; the stories appear in the table at the bottom of the image.

10. Here the NarraFirma user is designing a plan for a sensemaking session, where people will work with the collected stories and patterns to make sense of the topic being explored.

11. Here the NarraFirma user is ansewring questions about the outcomes of the project for each participant group. Those outcomes will determine recommendations for interventions.

12. Here the NarraFirma user is reflecting on the entire project, to learn from it and to keep good records for the future.

== Changelog ==

= 1.6.7 =

Changed: Made "Does not apply" slider label settable and translateable in general (not only for specific questions)

= 1.6.6 =

Added: You can now use display lumping to rename a too-long answer or put aside an answer that was rarely chosen (use with care and respect)
Added: In display lumping, you can comment out a line by placing a semicolon at the beginning of it (helps with trying different schemes)

Fixed: Bug where stories appeared out of order in survey form. 

= 1.5.23 = 

Fixed: Bug I thought I had fixed long ago, in the "chooser" boxes where you add questions to a story form. Showing the question texts broke the associations. Removed them.

= 1.5.22 =

Fixed: I forgot to save one file (package.json) with the new version number in the previous release. That's all.

Added: Page (in Planning) to help you observe and reflect on a story-sharing conversation.
Added: Page (in Planning) to help you build and print a project privacy policy. 
Added: Journaling pages for reflections at the end of each project phase.
Added: In Planning, added a few more questions about participant groups (these new questions are not linked to the recommendations system).

= 1.5.18 =

Added: Validation check to make sure that all questions have types.
Added: Validation check to make sure that questions of types that require answer lists (select, radiobuttons, checkboxes) have answer lists. 
Added: For validation support, if you are editing a list item and you click a page-change button, a message will appear asking you to close the currently open item first. (NF needs you to do this so it can run its validation checks.)
Added: Global error pop-up that shows the same message as is posted to the development console (for those who don't know about or can't find the development console).
Changed: Improved error reporting when questions that should have but are missing answer lists are imported from CSV.
Changed: Improved error message in survey itself when a question that requires an answer list has no answer list. 
Changed: NF's HTML cleanup process has always interpreted a single angle bracket (<) as the start of an HTML tag (and showed an error if there is no closing bracket). This is a problem for texts like "<25" (an age bracket). Now NF just prints out the < and lets you figure out if it's an incomplete HTML tag.

= 1.5.13 =

Fixed: Bug where choose-questions-for-story-form widget was not matching up questions correctly if question short names had extra (leading or trailing) blank spaces. (Now any extra blank spaces are trimmed off.)
Fixed: Bug where extra (empty) lines in choice-question available-answers lists were creating malformed survey HTML, causing the error "Something went wrong loading the survey questionnaire from the server." (Blank lines are now being trimmed out correctly.)

= 1.5.24 =

This essential upgrade fixes a bug in which stories are shown out of order on the survey form.

= 1.5.23 = 

This essential upgrade fixes a bug I thought I had fixed a long time ago. I stupidly thought it would be nice if, when adding questions to a story form, you could see the long as well as short names. Doing this broke the assignments. I thought I had fixed the problem! I hadn't. Now it is fixed.

= 1.5.22 =

This minor upgrade just fixes a non-matching release number in one place. That's all.

= 1.5.21 =

This minor upgrade adds a new import option (for multi-choice data with intermingled write-in answers) and improves help for data import and changes to story forms.

= 1.5.20 =

This minor upgrade fixes a bug in printing story cards where story-form question-answers were not appearing.

= 1.5.13 =
This minor upgrade fixes two tiny bugs you might have run into if you had extra (blank) leading or trailing spaces in your question short names, or if you had extra (empty) lines in your available-answers lists. NF now deals more elegantly with both situations.

= 1.5.12 =
This minor upgrade fixes two bugs: (a) the texts of edited stories did not appear correctly in the "Show story texts for copying" popup on the "Explore Patterns" page, and (b) annotation import and bulk change might not work correctly for edited stories.

= 1.5.11 =
This tiny upgrade improves error handling for empty (no-name) questions. The application was choking on them during export.

This minor but critical upgrade fixes a bug where the survey erroneously believed entered stories had no names. It also fixes a few smaller bugs and improves the help system.

= 1.5.5 =
This minor but critical upgrade fixes a bug in the WordPress PHP code that could cause new NarraFirma installations to show a blank screen instead of the setup page.

= 1.5.4 = 
This minor upgrade fixes a small bug in the display lumping system. (A lumped count could be off when somebody chose and then un-chose an answer.)

= 1.5.3 =
This minor upgrade adds the option to set the catalysis graph height as well as width (onscreen and in the printed report).

= 1.5.2 =
This minor upgrade makes the clustering process (used in planning and catalysis) a little easier. It also fixes a few small bugs.

This minor upgrade adds a few more options for narrative catalysis.

= 1.2.4 =
This upgrade improves support for narrative catalysis. It adds several features that help you go through the process more easily.

= 1.2.3 = 
This is a critical upgrade. Please apply it right away. It fixes a bug we introduced in version 1.2.0, in which exporting a project snapshot "with stories" did not actually export any stories. We apologize for the mistake. There is also a fix for a bug in the Mann-Whitney U test (some blank values were being erroneously counted). The update also improves error handling for projects with large numbers of questions.

= 1.2.2 = 
This minor upgrade copies a few buttons (important to importing data) to some more useful places. It also fixes a few annoying bugs.

= 1.2.1 =

WordPress users should upgrade to this version. It contains a fix for a bug that could lose data in checkbox survey questions. A "Does not apply" option was added for slider questions. There are also some improvements to graphs and usability.

= 0.9.6 =
WordPress users should upgrade to this version as it contains a security fix.

= 0.9.5 =
Improvements for Node.js version and README/SETUP for installation. There is no need to upgrade to this version for WordPress users.

= 0.9.4 =
This upgrade fixes a bug where the web survey always used the first version of a question form and would never disable it. It also uses a NarraFirma namespace in the WordPress plugin PHP file to conform with WordPress guidelines.
