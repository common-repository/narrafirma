<h1 class="page-title">Review graphs</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
On this page you can look at initial patterns in the data being collected over the web (or entered by you). This page is not meant to support a comprehensive, systematic look at your patterns; that will happen in the <a href="../catalysis/help_page_catalysis.html">catalysis</a> phase of your project. This page (and the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page) are for watching your stories come in and looking to see if your story collection is going well.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
<b>Choose one or two questions</b> to explore. You will see graphs in these combinations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Choice question: a bar graph. Hover your mouse over any of the "blocks" on the graph to see a "popup hint" with the story represented by that block.</li>
<li>Scale question: a histogram (with stories arrayed in "bins" across the scale). Hover over any block to read the story.</li>
<li>Choice question x choice question: a contingency chart (with bubbles showing how many stories match each combination of choices). Hover over any ellipse to see the names of stories in that bubble.</li>
<li>Choice question x scale question: a series of histograms. Hover over blocks in the histograms to read stories.</li>
<li>Scale question x scale question: a scatterplot. Hover your mouse over each dot to read the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you use your mouse to <b>draw a selection rectangle</b> on any graph, you will see the stories in that selection listed below the graph.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Connections to other pages</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
To review your graphs, you must first (a) create a 
<a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">story collection</a> (which must be associated with a
<a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">story form</a>) and (b)
<a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">collect</a>, 
<a href="help_page_enterStories.html">enter</a>, or 
<a href="help_page_enterStories.html">import</a> some stories. 
You cannot make any changes to your data on this page. To change your data, 
	go to the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page.

</div>

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
If I asked a question, and it had a lot of possible answers, and some of the answer counts turned out to be really low, is there
anything I can do about it?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes there is. You can use display lumping to merge multiple low-count answers together. See the help page on
<a href="../catalysis/help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">Configuring your catalysis report</a> for details.
