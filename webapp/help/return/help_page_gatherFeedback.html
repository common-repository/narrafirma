<h1 class="page-title">Gather feedback</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
As you finish the most prominent parts of your project, people are likely to tell you things about it. 
It's a good idea to note down these things so you can remember (and use) them later. 
This page gives you a place to remember feedback about the project.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
For each piece of feedback you receive, make some notes on it here.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Connections to other pages</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
	This page is for your records only. Using it has no effect on any other page in the application.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Is this form only for feedback after the other parts of the project are over?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. You can use it to record feedback you get on the project at any time during its activities. 
If someone says something during a story collection session (like "I'm glad you're listening to people"), 
you can record it here. Just remember to note when the feedback took place, so you can remember it later.
