<div class="text">
<p>
Creating story elements from a group of stories is a sensemaking exercise. Using this exercise to make sense of
the stories you told about your future project can help you figure out what matters most about the project.
It can also help you avoid mistakes in which you don't realize what you <i>really</i> want your project to achieve.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
What is the point of this exercise?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
By looking deeply into what is "inside" each story, you can think deeply about what you hope and fear might happen in your project. 
This micro-project will help you make decisions about your project, in the same way that your project will help 
people in your community or organization make decisions about the topic of your project.

<h3 class="question">
Why would I want to resize the clustering space?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
We don't know how big your screen is, so we set the diagram to a size we think many people will find useful. If the diagram is too large or too small for your screen, you can change it.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Why would I want to edit my answers and clusters in JSON format?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
We're programmers, and we like mucking around with raw data. If you like doing that too, you can edit your clustered items directly. 
If you don't want to do that, ignore this option.
