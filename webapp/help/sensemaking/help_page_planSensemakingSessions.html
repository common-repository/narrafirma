<h1 class="page-title">Plan sensemaking sessions</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
On this page you can design plans for sensemaking sessions, where people explore the topic of your 
project using the stories and patterns you have collected. Later on you can <a href="help_page_enterSensemakingSessionRecords.html">record</a> 
what happened in your sessions.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Each session plan starts with some questions about when, where, with whom, and how you will carry out the session. 
The questions are meant to help you think about what you will do (and not forget anything). 
</p>
<p>
You can also create a list of activities you will carry out (in order) during your session. 
While creating a new activity, you can copy a template (then make changes as you like). 
</p>
<p>
When you are done designing your session, you can export your agenda (to HTML). You can print this file 
and take it with you to the session; or you can open the file in another program and format it the way you like. 
This is a useful option when you will have helpers in the session, because you'll be able to give them a plan they can follow.
</p>
<p>
For help choosing, click the <b>Recommendations for sensemaking sessions</b> button. 
You'll see a table that shows the various options, color-coded with evaluations of risk.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Where did these activity templates come from?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Most of them are from the book <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>. 
Some of the simpler ones are from various group facilitation guides on the internet.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Can I create my own activity template?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Only if you are comfortable editing the source code files in your installation of NarraFirma. If you are, 
find the file called "templates.js" and add your template to it. (Backup the file first!) Follow the formatting in the 
templates you see, and make sure you put your template in the right part of the file. If NarraFirma won't start up after 
you make your changes, check your browser's console to find out where the error lies.
