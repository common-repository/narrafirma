<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="catalysis">catalysis</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In PNI terms, catalysis is looking for (and at) patterns in stories and data (usually answers to questions about stories and about people), using the methods of mixed-methods analysis. Catalysis is like analysis in that it looks for patterns in data, but it departs from analysis when it posits multiple competing interpretations of the patterns found. The point of catalysis is not to provide answers but to open up questions for discussion. Analysis produces answers; catalysis produces food for thought.

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="elicitingquestions">eliciting questions</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
An eliciting question invites someone to tell a story. Eliciting questions might reference a time frame 
("What happened on your first day at work?"), a place ("Did anything surprising ever happen to you
at this supermarket?"), a high or low point ("What was your best day as a nurse?"), and so on. The best
story-eliciting questions cannot be answered in any other way than by telling a story.
</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="interpretation">interpretation</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In catalysis terms, an interpretations is something a reasonable person
might say about an observation. Thus if an observation is, "older people
said they felt more afraid of mice," one interpretation might be "older people
grew up living in less sanitary conditions" or "older people are more aware of real dangers."
</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="intervention">intervention</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In PNI terms, an intervention is an action intended to change the stories people tell. Examples are narrative therapy, participatory theatre, and sensemaking spaces. Ideally, an intervention should be planned based on sensemaking following story collection, so that the intervention is well grounded in the reality of the community or organization and will fit its needs and context.

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="mixedmethodsresearch">mixed-methods research</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
Mixed-methods research combines the collection and examination of qualitative (usually text-based) and quantitative (numerical) to create an outcome that blends the best of both traditions. There are many ways of conducting mixed-methods research, from keeping the research "strands" separate to intermingling them. PNI intermingles them quite extensively, whether it's during catalysis or during sensemaking.
</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="observation">observation</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In catalysis terms, an observation is a descriptive statement that summarizes a pattern,
like "older people said they felt more afraid of mice." 
</p>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="pni">participatory narrative inquiry</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
Participatory narrative inquiry (PNI) is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex situations for better decision making. PNI focuses on the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the
recounting and interpretation of lived experience. PNI draws on theory and practice in narrative inquiry, participatory action research, oral history, mixed-methods research, participatory theatre, narrative therapy, sensemaking, complexity theory, and decision support.

<p>
The textbook <em>Working with Stories in Your Community or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry</em>
(by Cynthia Kurtz)
explains how to conduct PNI projects. You can find <em>Working with Stories</em> at 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Stories-Your-Community-Organization/dp/0991369408">amazon.com</a> 
and at the book's <a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">web site</a>.

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="pattern">pattern</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In catalysis terms, a pattern is something you can see in the data you have collected.
Patterns are usually displayed as graphs or statistical tests.
</p>
</div>


<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="perspective">perspective</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In catalysis, a perspective is a meaningful grouping of interpretations.
Perspectives make up the headings of a catalysis report.
</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="phase">phase</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
A phase is the same thing as a step or section or part. I like to call the parts of PNI "phases" because they don't always proceed in a step-wise fashion. A project might have a very long collection phase and a short sensemaking phase, or three collection phases. Few projects flow in simple ways.
</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="questionsaboutstories">questions about stories</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>Ã¥
In PNI we ask people questions about their stories. We do this to gather more information on what the stories mean to their tellers (and sometimes to others). We also do this to include storytellers in the sensemaking that takes place in the project, so they benefit from it as well. People usually say that they enjoy thinking about their stories (as long as the questions are well written and there aren't too many of them).
</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="questionsaboutpeople">questions about people</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In PNI we ask people questions about themselves. These fit into four categories:
<ul>
<li>questions about demographics, like age and gender</li>
<li>questions about personalities, like how people learn and whether they are big-picture thinkers</li>
<li>questions about roles, like what jobs people do in an organization</li>
<li>questions about issues, like what people think about an official policy</li>
</ul>
Questions about issues can be useful to place in juxtaposition with questions about stories, because they represent the "poker face" people put on when asked for their opinions. Sometimes there are revealing differences between what people say they believe and what their stories say.
</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary_definition"><a id="storyform">story form</a></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In PNI terms, a story form is a set of questions used to elicit stories and their interpretations. There are three types of question in a story form: 
<ul>
<li>questions that elicit stories, like "Have your ever felt your life was in danger?"</li>
<li>questions that invite people to interpret stories, like "Do you think the people in that story acted responsibly?"</li>
<li>questions about people, like "How old are you?"</li>
</li>
A story form includes all three types of question. Story forms can be used online, in printed form, or spoken (during interviews).
