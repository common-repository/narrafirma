<h1 class="page-title">Write story eliciting questions</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
In your PNI project, you will ask three kinds of questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>questions that invite people to tell stories (which you write on this page)</li>
<li><a href="help_page_writeQuestionsAboutStories.html">questions about the stories people tell</a></li>
<li><a href="help_page_writeQuestionsAboutParticipants.html">questions about the people who tell the stories</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
These three sets of questions combine to create a <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">story form</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Add some eliciting questions to your list. For each question, write what you want to ask people. 
</p>
<p>Give each question a short name (so there's room to write the question name in tables and on graphs).
As a general rule, short names should be less than 20 characters long.
</p>
<p>
You can copy questions from built-in templates (suggestions). Change the blank spaces (_____) in the question to suit your project and participants.
</p>
<p>
For help choosing, click the "Recommendations for eliciting questions" button. You'll see a table that shows the various options, color-coded with evaluations of risk, connected to the answers you gave to questions about your <a href="../planning/help_page_participantGroups.html">participant groups</a> and <a href="../planning/help_page_describeYourResources.html">resources</a>. 
</p>

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
	What's a good story-eliciting question?
	</h3>
	<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
		Good eliciting questions are respectfully curious and intrinsically interesting questions whose answers are stories.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you are not sure whether a question is respectfully curious, 
			find some project participants (or potential participants) and ask them the question.
			Then watch their faces and their body language. 
			What emotional reactions do you see? 
			Do they look (or lean or move) towards you or away from you?
			Do they seem happy to be invited to consider the question?
			Or do they seem confused, intimidated, or offended?
			Also, do they seem to consider the question a reasonable way to explore the topic you are exploring? 
			Or do they seem to think it strange (or boring or uncomfortable or upsetting) that you are asking it of them?
		</li>
		<li>
			If you are not sure whether a question is intrinsically interesting, 
			again, try asking it of people. Then look for signs of genuine interest.
			Do they smile?
			Does their body language seem relaxed?
			Do they seem to enjoy the opportunity to look back over their memories and ponder the issue?
			Or do they seem to snap to attention, eager to conform to your expectations?
			Or do they seem to rush for cover, eager to find somewhere to hide?
		</li>
		<li>
			If you are not sure whether the answers to a question are stories,
			try to answer it without telling a story. If it's easy to do that, reword the question.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
How many eliciting questions should I write?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
A larger variety of eliciting questions is good, because it means people will have an easier time finding a question they want to answer. 
But at the same time, people get bored and frustrated when lists are long. How many is too many depends on your project and its participants. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>For a <strong>kiosk</strong> type project, in which people are just walking by and have no commitment to the project at all, ask no more than <strong>three</strong> eliciting questions.</li>
<li>For a <strong>volunteer</strong> type project, in which people feel socially obligated to participate, you can ask <strong>up to five</strong> eliciting questions.</li>
<li>For a <strong>commitment</strong> type project, in which people feel that participating is linked to their identities, you can go above five questions up to <strong>seven or eight</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The number of eliciting questions you can use also depends on your <a href="help_page_chooseCollectionMethods.html">collection method</a>. 
If you can hand people a sheet of paper with your questions on it, you can show them more questions at once. 
But if you're doing interviews (individual, group, or peer) you need to keep the number of questions smaller.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Can I write just one eliciting question?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	Remember that the number of eliciting questions you <i>write</i> and the number of eliciting questions
	you <i>include</i> on a story form are not the same thing.
	You can write ten eliciting questions and include only one of them on your story form. 
	</p>
	<p>
	If you choose to use only one eliciting question on a story form, the question will simply be asked at the start of
	the form, without the participant being given a <i>choice</i> between eliciting questions. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
How do I set the order of the eliciting questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You don't set the question order here. You only create the questions here. 
This is just a library of available questions.
You set the order of questions when you design your story form. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Can I use HTML formatting for eliciting questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can use these HTML tags for eliciting questions:
b, big, em, i, s, small, sup, sub, strong, strike, and u.
</p>
<p>
HTML tags affect how your question texts appear in your online survey and in the "Enter or import stories" screen. 
They are stripped out when you print your story form.
</p>
<p>
To protect your NarraFirma installation from hacking, you cannot use attributes (such as "id") on any of these tags.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Do the question types (directed, undirected, etc) limit what I can write in the question? Do they limit how people can answer?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. The question types are just here to help you think of questions you might want to ask. 
All eliciting questions are answered in the same way, with a large text area where the participant tells a story.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
What do the question types mean?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(pages 123-129) that explain the question types.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<div class="book-quote-heading">Asking what happened</div> 
<p>Compare these two questions:
</p>
<ol> 
<li> Can you remember your first day at work?</li>
<li> Can you remember your first day at work? What happened on that day?</li>
</ol> 
<p>The first question breaks the cardinal rule of asking a question whose answer is a story, and the second doesn&rsquo;t. The &ldquo;what happened&rdquo; bandage can fix many an ailing question. Of course, it can be irritating to have &ldquo;what happened&rdquo; stuck onto the end of every question you ask. But sometimes it is not necessary, and when it is, it can be reworded in many ways, like asking what people did or said. You can also add it into the question itself, as with &ldquo;Can you tell me what happened on your first day at work?&rdquo;
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">Directed questions</div> 
<p>A directed question is one that directly asks someone to talk about an issue important to the project. 
</p>
<p>Examples of directed questions are:
</p>
<ul> 
<li> Was there ever a time when you were surprised by how <i>connected</i> or disconnected you were to the community?</li>
<li> Have you ever felt <i>overwhelmed</i> with information?</li>
<li> When you came into our office this morning, did anything happen that made you feel more or less <i>important</i> to us? </li>
<li> Can you remember ever waking up and not wanting to go to work because you felt you couldn&rsquo;t face such a <i>hostile</i> environment again?</li>
</ul> 
<div class="book-quote-heading">Undirected questions</div> 
<p>An <i>undirected</i> story-eliciting question is one that doesn&rsquo;t ask about a particular issue, but asks about the person&rsquo;s experiences in general. 
</p>
<p>Examples of undirected questions are:
</p>
<ul> 
<li> What happened on your <i>first day</i> at work?</li>
<li> Tell me about your <i>wedding</i>.</li>
<li> Can you tell me about your <i>visit</i> to the doctor&rsquo;s office today?</li>
<li> Can you remember your <i>best moment</i> as a doctor?</li>
</ul> 
<p>When you ask undirected questions, you tend to get more raw emotions and honest reflections. People love to talk about things like the day they met their spouse or the moment they first skydived. The disadvantage of using undirected questions is that you cannot control <i>what</i> people will talk about, and only a fraction of the stories may be about topics important to the project. Directed questions focus on the issues you want to know about, but because you are asking people for something specific, people will be more likely to try to give you what they think you want rather than speaking freely from experience.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">Point in time</div> 
<p>This approach asks people to select a time reference of importance (a moment, time, point, minute, hour, day, week, month, year) and tell what happened during it. For example:
</p>
<ul> 
<li> What was the most <i>memorable</i> hour of your career at this company?</li>
<li> Can you recall what day of your tenure at the university <i>stands out</i> most in your memory?</li>
<li> What moment of your visit to the zoo was most <i>interesting</i> to you?</li>
<li> Could you describe the week when your campaign <i>struggled</i> the most?</li>
<li> Can you tell us about your <i>proudest</i> hour as a firefighter?</li>
<li> You waited in a line in our department today. Was there a time during your wait when you felt <i>frustrated?</i></li>
<li> Was there ever a moment when you felt that <i>trust</i> in your team was either strengthened or weakened?</li>
<li> At what point during your stay at our hotel did you find yourself the most <i>relaxed?</i></li>
<li> Can you describe a time when you made a major <i>discovery</i> in your understanding of your research topic?</li>
</ul> 

<p>The advantage of the point-in-time approach is that it helps people with long experience to avoid generalizing or summarizing. Asking for a particular time reference helps people to understand that you want to know about something that happened <i>in time,</i> not outside of it. The disadvantage is that people might tell you what block of time was important without actually telling you what <i>happened</i> during it. They might say something like &ldquo;The worst day was that day at the zoo.&rdquo; Adding &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; at the end of the question can help with that problem.
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">Event</div> 

<p>Another method similar to asking about a point in time is asking people to select an event (or episode, incident, occurrence, occasion, situation, circumstance) and tell about it (or describe, recount, depict, relate). For example:
</p>

<ul> 
<li> What event most <i>stands out</i> in your mind from your years as a mail carrier?</li>
<li> Did anyone speak to you today in a way you will <i>remember</i> for a long time?</li>
<li> Can you describe an occasion you remember as being <i>important</i> on your bus route in the past year?</li>
<li> Is there a particular incident you feel the most <i>distressed</i> about that happened while you were in hospital?</li>
<li> Tell me about a time when you felt too <i>worn out</i> to come to work.</li>
<li> Can you recount for us an event that took place during your time here when you felt particularly <i>calm</i> and at ease?</li>
<li> Our museum&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;Everyone wants to <i>learn</i>.&rdquo; Was there a moment during your visit today in which that motto was particularly well supported by someone you met?</li>
<li> When you think of the phrase &ldquo;<i>trust</i> takes years to build but can be broken in a second,&rdquo; what one event of the past seven years stands out most in your mind?</li>
<li> Could you relate to us a situation when your <i>leadership</i> skills were challenged?</li>
</ul> 

<p>The advantage of asking about an event is that it makes it clear that you want people to recall things that happened to them. This may prod people who don&rsquo;t understand the recounting nature of the task to understand what is being asked of them. A disadvantage, however, is that people might feel that the events they remember are not sufficiently important to be counted as Events&mdash;with a capital E&mdash;and may not respond. People are <i>terrible</i> judges of whether something is important, especially when it comes to personal stories. 
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">Extreme</div> 

<p>This approach involves asking people to remember exceptional experiences. For example:
</p>

<ul> 
<li> Can you tell us about the <i>highlight</i> of your last project?</li>
<li> What was the <i>worst</i> thing that ever happened in your years in the department?</li>
<li> What was the <i>best</i> moment of your visit to the library today? </li>
<li> As your car was being worked on today, when did you feel the most <i>frustrated</i> with the process?</li>
<li> What was the <i>angriest</i> you ever felt in all the years you worked at this job?</li>
<li> Can you remember the <i>happiest</i> you ever felt in this community?</li>
<li> Can you remember feeling particularly <i>appreciated</i> in your work?</li>
<li> Have you ever been exceptionally frustrated at a <i>communication</i> gap between yourself and your students?</li>
<li> During your school day today, when did you feel you <i>learned</i> the most?</li>
</ul> 

<p>Watch out for a possible misfire here. If you ask people something like &ldquo;Can you remember feeling frustrated?&rdquo; you run the risk of them saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and nothing else. Or even if you say, &ldquo;What was the worst thing that ever happened?&rdquo; they might respond with, &ldquo;The bank closing.&rdquo; For this reason, I always recommend either adding the &ldquo;what happened&rdquo; addendum to any extreme question or combining it with another question type, like an event or point-in-time question.
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">Surprise or change</div> 

<p>This approach asks people to remember a time in which their expectations have been overturned or in which something important changed (other useful words are surprise, turning point, shift, change, climax, crux, transition, crisis, and critical moment). For example:
</p>
<ul> 
<li> Can you remember a time when you were <i>surprised</i> at how well a project was going?</li>
<li> Was there ever a moment when things seemed to shift and <i>change,</i> and after that nothing was the same again?</li>
<li> Can you tell me about a time during our training class today when you were <i>surprised</i> by something the teacher said?</li>
<li> Tell us about a memorable <i>crisis</i> at the police station.</li>
<li> What do you think was a <i>turning point</i> in your thinking about diplomacy?</li>
<li> Can you tell us about a <i>critical moment</i> in your estate planning process?</li>
</ul> 

<p>The advantage of this approach is that it can help people who think they have nothing to say find something to say. It helps them select an event to tell about. 
</p>

<p>The disadvantage is that it opens the door for people who don&rsquo;t want to respond to say, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never been surprised,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;No, nothing has ever changed.&rdquo; If you expect indifference or hostility to your questions, you might not want to give people this exit. But if people are going to be meek or find it difficult to choose things to talk about (perhaps because you are asking them to reminisce about a forty-year career), this approach can be helpful.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">People, places, things, decisions</div> 

<p>This approach asks people to recall a particular decision, location, person, or object and talk about their experiences with it. 
</p>
Some example questions might be:<ul> 
<li> What happened at the moment when you decided to join our <i>faculty?</i> </li>
<li> When you drove into town today, did you notice the new <i>park?</i> Or did you drive right by it without seeing it? What happened as you drove by it?</li>
<li> Do you remember the first time you walked into this <i>courtroom?</i> What happened on that day?</li>
<li> Can you recount for us the day you first met your <i>spouse?</i> </li>
<li> You&rsquo;ve been driving this <i>car</i> for nearly twenty years now. When you look at it, do any special times come to mind? </li>
</ul> 

<p>The advantage of this approach is that it focuses people on something you want them to talk about. The disadvantage is that after you&rsquo;ve focused them on the subject, they may forget to tell a story about it and simply start talking about it.
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">Fictional scenario</div> 

<p>Another method involves asking a question that sets up a fictional situation. For example, you might say:
</p>
<blockquote> A parent you met at your school&rsquo;s open house calls you and says she is going to send her son to another school because &ldquo;nobody here cares anymore.&rdquo; What story might you tell, either from your own experience or that you heard about, to help her decide what to do?</blockquote> 

<p>This approach can be useful when the people you are asking to tell stories will not be willing to tell you their real opinion about a sensitive topic. Asking them about a fictional situation navigates them past their automatic reaction and may get them to talk about a touchy subject when a more direct question would not. 
</p>

<p>However, results of this approach can be hit-or-miss, mainly because the reasoning required to understand the request is convoluted. People sometimes reply to fictional-scenario questions with one of two misfires: they <i>refer</i> to the story they would tell without actually telling it (&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell them about when I first moved here&rdquo;), or they forget all about telling a story and just say what they would tell the person (&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell them to give my school another try&rdquo;). 
</p>

<p>If if you expect people to be very reluctant or closed-mouthed or unwilling to admit things, this approach <i>might</i> prod them to reveal things they wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise, though they may need some help getting there. Otherwise I would use it only when there are other options available for those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t follow you down the path of fictional exploration.
