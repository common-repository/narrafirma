<p>
In the sensemaking phase of a PNI project, some or all community members (and sometimes interested others) 
participate in group activities in which they negotiate meaning as they construct larger stories, 
possibly in the form of artifacts such as timelines, landscapes, and story elements. Sensemaking may take place on the same day as 
story collection or months later; it may involve few or many people; it may take place in person or through some form of 
mediated contact; and it may be strongly or weakly structured and facilitated. But in some way, 
<em>all PNI projects involve somebody making some use of gathered stories to better understand some situation or issue</em>.
