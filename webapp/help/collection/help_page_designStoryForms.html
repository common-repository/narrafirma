<div class="text">
<p>
In NarraFirma, <strong>story forms</strong> are sets of questions (surveys, questionnaires) you show to people 
to invite them to tell stories and answer questions about their stories.</p>
<p>
A story form combines <strong>three types of questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>eliciting questions (in answer to which people tell stories on the form)</li>
<li>questions about stories (which ask people to reflect on the story they just told)</li>
<li>questions about participants (direct questions unrelated to any story)</li>
</ol>
<p>
These three types of questions come together, in that order, on the story form.
</p>
<p>
A story form has <strong>three possible uses</strong>, depending on how you are using NarraFirma.
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you collect your stories on-line using NarraFirma, your participants will interact with the story forms you create.</li>
<li>If you collect your stories off-line and enter them into NarraFirma, <em>you</em> will interact with the story form.</li>
<li>If you <a href="help_page_importGuide.html">import</a> your stories, your story form will describe your data to NarraFirma.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
To create a new story form, click the <b>Add</b> button, then give the story form a short, unique name. Give the story form a title, 
which will appear at the start of the form. 
Then write an introduction, something like "Please tell us about your experiences." 
</p><p>
Next, choose one or more questions that will invite people
to share a story on your form, drawing from the <a href="help_page_writeStoryElicitingQuestions.html">eliciting questions</a> you created previously.
Use the up and down arrow buttons to change the order in which your eliciting questions will appear.
</p><p>
Continue to work your way down the page, filling in the fields that define the story form. Read the instructions and tips for each item. 
</p><p>
	After you have filled in all of the fields to define your story form, click <b>Preview</b> to see how your story form will appear to participants.
</p><p>
	Now click <b>Show advanced options</b>, then look over the page again. 
	See if you want to use any of the available-but-optional features that don't apply to every story form.
	(For example, only some forms will include an introductory video.)
</p>
<p>If the library of questions you created on the previous pages is identical to the questions you want to include on your story form,
	you can save yourself some time by <b>generating</b> a form that simply includes all existing questions. 
	A generated story form is not a different type of form; it's just a shortcut you can use to avoid having to click on each question.
</p>
<p>You can also use this page to import a story form from a CSV file. See the <a href="help_page_importGuide.html">Guide to importing data</a>
	for details on this option.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Connections to other pages</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
	Each story form on this page must draw from the
	<a href="help_page_writeStoryElicitingQuestions.html">eliciting questions</a>,
	<a href="help_page_writeQuestionsAboutStories.html">questions about stories</a>, and 
	<a href="help_page_writeQuestionsAboutParticipants.html">questions about participants</a>
	you created on the three previous pages.
	<b>A story form is a <em>grouping</em> of questions, not a <em>copy</em> of them.</b>
	Any changes you make to a question after you add it to a story form will appear in the form. 
	Why can't you just write your questions on this page? So you can <b>reuse the same questions on multiple story forms</b>.
</p>
<p>
	When you associate a story form with a <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">story collection</a>, 
	a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the story form, <em>as it appears at that moment</em>, 
	is <strong>copied</strong> into the story collection. Any changes you make to the form 
	or the questions <em>after</em> that moment will <em>not</em> be automatically reflected in the story collection. 
	This is because once you start collecting (or entering) stories, you need all of your data 
	to match up (or you won't see patterns in it).
	</p>
	<img src="help_importGuide_dataStorage.png" width="800">
	<p>
	You can <em>update</em> your story collection to use a revised story form 
	(in the <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">Start story collection</a> page). 
	But you should do this with caution. Use it to fix typographical errors, not changes that could alter 
	the data you have already collected.
	</p>

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Do I have to use more than one eliciting question?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. If you create only one eliciting question, NarraFirma will show it (without choices) on the story form above the text box for the story.
If you have no eliciting questions at all (usually because you imported your data), NarraFirma will assign the question "What happened?" as the 
eliciting question for every story (and you can ignore it).
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
What should I do where it asks me what I want to say to participants?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
There are several places on a story form where you can specify messages to participants. All of these places have defaults (shown below in bold), so 
you don't <i>need</i> to customize them; but you can. Here are some ways to phrase these messages.
</p>
<p><b>Please choose a question to which you would like to respond.</b> Some other ideas are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which of these questions would you like to answer?</li>
		<li>Choose a question that appeals to you.</li>
		<li>Which of these questions connects best to your experiences?</li>
		<li>Pick the question you like best.</li>
<li>But don't say:
<ul>
<li>Choose the question that best fits your story. (This implies that they already "have" a story, and only one story, to tell.)</li>
<li>You must choose one of these questions. (Doesn't invite; is not conversational.)</li>
	<li>Choose the best question for your experiences. (Asking people to rank questions may cause them to think 
				that you will be ranking their story. You can use the word "best," but use it to describe connection or fit, not quality.
				Never even hint that quality is what you are looking for.)</li>
				<li>Do any of these questions relate to your experiences? (Sometimes the answer will just be "no".)</li>
				</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<b>Please enter your response in the box below.</b> Some other ideas are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Please answer the question you chose here.</li>
			<li>You can type your answer here.</li>
			<li>Tell us what happened here. What do you remember?</li>
			<li>But don't say:
					<ul>
			<li>Answer the question to the best of your ability. (It sounds like an interrogation.)</li>
			<li>Explain what happened here. (You'll only get dry facts if you ask that way.)</li>
			<li>Give us your story here. (It makes their story into a thing, not a conversation.)
			</li>
		</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<b>Please give your story a name.</b> Some other ideas are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>What name would you like to give this story?</li>
			<li>If you were to give this story a name, what would it be?</li>
			<li>How would you like to refer to this story?</li>
		<li>But don't say:
				<ul>
			<li>Give your story a title. (The word "title" is performative, and it makes people worry that their story will not be good enough.
				The word "name" puts less pressure on the teller.)</li>
			<li>If your story was in a newspaper, what headline would it have? (If these are personal stories, people will not want to visualize them being in a newspaper. Also, 
					asking people to write a headline makes the story seem like you want it to be exciting or sensational.)</li>
			<li>Give us a way to refer to your story. (It makes the story seem like a thing.)
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>


<p>
<b>Would you like to tell another story?</b> Some other ideas are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Is there any other experience you would like to tell us about?</li>
			<li>Would you like to tell us about something else that happened?</li>
			<li>Does this story remind you of another experience you'd like to tell us about?</li>
			<li>Is there another experience you can recall that you think would be helpful for our project?</li>
			<li>But don't say:
					<ul>
			<li>Do you have any other stories to tell? (It makes people feel that you are taking things from them, not talking to them.)</li>
			<li>Think of another story you can give us. (Same problem: it makes the story seem like a thing being taken from people.)</li>
			<li>Is there anything else you'd like to tell us? (There is no reference to stories or experiences here. People will expect to have a chance to type in opinions or something.
				 You can give them such a chance, but you should use a non-story-eliciting question to do it.)
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

<p>
	<b>Yes, I'd like to tell another story.</b> This is the text on the button people push to tell another story. Some other ideas are:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>Yes</li>
					<li>I would like to tell another story</li>
					<li>I remember another time I could tell you about</li>
				<li>I would like to tell about another experience</li>
				<li>But don't say:
						<ul>
				<li>I have another story (Anything you can "have" is a thing. This should be a conversation.)</li>
				<li>I have more to say (They might not realize you want them to tell another <i>story</i>.)</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<h3 class="question">
		How do I use the "Custom CSS" feature?
		</h3>
		<div class="question-answer">
		<p>
		Preview your story form and use your browser to <strong>inspect</strong> any element of the page you want to change. 
		(The usual way to do this is to right-click on a word or area and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the popup menu that appears.
		If you don't see a popup menu or an "Inspect" menu item, look up how to inspect a web page element in the browser you are using.
		Sometimes you need to turn on "developer" mode to inspect page elements.)
		</p>
		<p>When you have successfully inspected the page element you want to change, you should see its CSS class. Most of the classes start with "narrafirma-".
		</p>
		<p>Next go to the "custom CSS" field for your story form and
		write a class selector (label) and declaration (set of formatting lines)
		for that class. 
		For example, if you wanted to change the introductory text of your story form to appear in blue, you would write a CSS statement
		like this:
		<code><br/><br/>
			.narrafirma-survey-start-text { <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; color: blue;<br/>
		}<br/><br/>
		</code>
		<p>
			Then preview the form again to see your change. (Don't reload the preview page; you have to click the "Preview" button again.)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Notes on custom CSS</b></p>
		<ul>
				<li>The CSS you enter affects the survey's appearance when you preview it and when a participant sees it (using the URL you give them). 
						It is <i>not</i> used when you enter a story on the "Enter or import stories" page (because that form is a popup dialog, not a separate web page).
						If you need to change how the story entry dialog appears, you will need to change the CSS files distributed with NarraFirma.
						</li>
						<li>If you don't know how to use CSS, look through one of the many excellent tutorials on the web.</li>
		<li>In addition to classes, some survey elements have numbered IDs. Be careful using these,
			because the numbers will change if you move the questions around. But you can set styles on particular elements 
			(using the ID selector with #)
			after you are sure your question order will not change.
		</li>
		<li>If you don't want people to see a particular element of the form (like say the number on sliders), you can use Custom CSS to
			set the display tag to "none" (display: none) for that class or ID, and it won't appear on the page.
		</li>
		</div>

<h3 class="question">
How can I make my survey more accessible?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	We have tested three aspects of accessibility in NarraFirma's survey forms: scaling, keyboard access, and contrast.
</p>
<p><b>Scaling</b>. Participants can scale up all elements of the survey form using the Zoom function (usually Control- or Command- plus)
	on any modern browser.
	</p>
<p><b>Keyboard access</b>. Each element of the survey can be accessed without a mouse
	by using the <b>Tab</b> key to move between elements. Slider values can be changed using the left and right arrow keys.
</p>
<p>
	There is one slightly out-of-the-way interaction that you might want to tell
	your participants about. To the right of each slider there is a little number that shows the chosen value. 
	The number is invisible until the participant has chosen an initial value for the slider. 
</p>
<img src="help_designStoryForm_sliderValue.png" width="600">
<p>
	When you click (with a mouse) on that little number, a popup dialog appears on which you can type in a new number. 
	This is to help people set a specific number even if the slider is tiny on their (possibly tiny) screen. 
	Participants who are using a keyboard cannot click on that little number, but they can <b>Tab to it and press Enter</b> to get the same popup dialog. 
</p>
<p>Also note that participants who are using (at least some versions of) Safari must <i>turn on tabbing between items</i> in the Preferences window. 
</p>
<p><b>Contrast</b>. The default colors in the NarraFirma survey meet 
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> AAA standards for accessible text.
	If you like, however, you can change the colors in your survey to make it more readable (or just nicer looking).
	As of version 1.4.2, NarraFirma uses CSS variables to make it easier to set the colors of the various areas on the survey page. 
	To override the default colors, copy and paste the following "root" element into the "custom CSS" field, then change the hex color values.
	</p>
<pre style="background-color:white">

:root {
	--color-background-question-odd-story: #e1ebff; 
	--color-background-question-even-story: #e9f7ea; 
	--color-background-tell-another-story: #faf1d9;
	--color-background-question-participant: #faf1d9;

	--color-button-remove-story: #646262;
	--color-button-remove-story-text: white;
	--color-button-tell-another-story: #fde5a1;
	--color-button-tell-another-story-text: black;
	--color-button-submit-survey: #2c2cbd;
	--color-button-submit-survey-text: white;
}

</pre>
<p>You can of course leave out any lines that define colors you don't want to override.
</p>

<h3 class="question">
Do you have any advice for putting together story forms?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from pages 153-157) that can help you design story forms.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>
<p>A set of questions about a story is half of a conversation you hope to have with people about the story. To make sure the question set grows into a full conversation (of the kind that leads to excellent catalyzing material for sensemaking), here are some guidelines you can follow in how you put questions together.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Create an interesting, varied experience
</div>
<p>I recommend creating a <i>mixture</i> of question types (free entry, named choices, scales) within any set of questions about stories. I recommend this for two reasons. First, mixtures keep the question-answering activity interesting by reducing monotony. Even though people may be able to read and understand questions more quickly if they are all the same type, people may get one question confused with another or get bored. There is a natural tension between people&rsquo;s need to understand (hence the need for clarity and consistency) and their tendency to get bored or lose interest when things repeat (hence the need for variety). You can create clarity without sacrificing variety.
</p>
<p>Secondly, varied questions produce more interesting patterns to catalyze sensemaking. If you asked every single question with a fixed choice list, for example, all of your catalytic images would be bar graphs of counts (this many people told about dogs, this many about cats, etc.). But if you asked some fixed-choice questions, some scalar questions, and some free-entry questions, you will end up with several types of images: scatterplots, bubble correlation diagrams, annotated lists, even 3D landscapes. The point of catalysis is to stimulate thought and discussion, and for this diversity of images is a boon. So build diversity into your questions, the better to work with the answers later.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Design a conversational flow
</div>
<p>Order your questions like a conversation. Make them flow naturally. If you were asking someone questions in person, which would you start with? Having to switch gears or answer questions in an order that doesn&rsquo;t seem natural wastes cognitive budget. It is more important that a question seem related to the ones around it <i>by what it asks about</i> than by what type it is. Try asking your questions out loud. Listen to whether the order jars or flows freely. Does it make sense to ask about this after that? Does the story of the conversation flow naturally?
</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve found, for example, is that the &ldquo;how do you feel&rdquo; question likes to be asked right after the story is told. Doing this sets the stage for the questions that come after it. It communicates to the participants that you will be asking them to think about their personal feelings about the story, not asking them for facts and figures. In general, the further away you get from the story, the less vivid the storyteller&rsquo;s emotions about it will be, so it is often best to ask the more factual questions later. Asking factual questions first can put people into classification mode and reduce their emotional response when you need it most.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Create a question form that supports the flow of stories
</div>
<p>Your question form should <i>answer all expected questions</i> about the purpose of the session. For example, if you anticipate concerns about anonymity or the distribution of collected stories, address them on the form. 
</p>
<p>Your form should be <i>concise</i>. You cannot expect people to spend more than about thirty seconds reviewing the form, so you need to use that tiny budget wisely. Keep your statements to a few short sentences. For example, &ldquo;Today we are sharing experiences about our town&rsquo;s wildlife. Your input is anonymous. The stories we tell today will support future discussions.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Your form should be abundantly <i>clear</i>. To test this, take a draft of your form and place it in front of anyone you can find&mdash;neighbors, relatives, children&mdash;and ask them to skim it, then explain what they think it says. If what they say it says is not what you meant it to say, make another draft. The last thing you need is to have your group story session snagged on ten minutes of people asking what you mean by &ldquo;new urbanism&rdquo; or some other bit of jargon out of place.
</p>
<p>Your form should <i>not</i> include a lecture about stories or storytelling. This is a common mistake of inexperienced story collectors. It does not matter if participants know what a story is. It only matters if they tell stories. Whether they tell stories is more likely to be damaged than improved by information that will only make them self-conscious.
</p>
<p>Your form should be <i>grammatically perfect</i>. I know that sounds pedantic, but believe me, there <i>will</i> be pedants in any group of participants, and you will irritate them. The non-pedants will not be irritated, but they will still be distracted. Trivial things like subjects and verbs that don&rsquo;t agree, such as &ldquo;How long ago does the events in this story take place&rdquo; can stop people up. <i>Never disrupt the flow of stories</i>.
</p>
<p>The more smoothly your questions flow, the better the results you will see. Keep people focused on their own reflective processes, not on your presentation and its flaws. And be careful: once you&rsquo;ve been working on a question set for a while, it all begins to seem perfectly logical even if it isn&rsquo;t. Try your questions out on somebody you can watch, and see where they pause and ponder. Where does their pencil hover? Is it because they are thinking about the story, or because they are trying to figure out what you meant by your poorly presented question? Increase the former and reduce the latter.
</p>
<p>Your form should be <i>attractive,</i> even appealing. People respond to beautiful design. Handing your participants something printed badly in an unreadable m&eacute;lange of fonts sends a message that you don&rsquo;t value their contribution, because you didn&rsquo;t bother preparing something nice for them to work with. It&rsquo;s like inviting someone to visit your home, then asking them to sit on a dirty floor. Give people something beautiful that will feel like an honor to use. This may sound silly, but I&rsquo;ve seen it make a difference. When you want to get people telling stories, use every opportunity at your disposal to send a message of appreciation and respect. Pick up a book on &ldquo;design for dummies&rdquo; and take its advice.
</p>
<p>Lastly, your form should be a thought <i>landscape,</i> not a thought jail. Drop a casual hint at the start of the session that people can use their forms to take notes or make comments on the questions or the session or anything they like. Mention that if they don&rsquo;t like a question they can write that, or if they can&rsquo;t decide between two answers they can circle both (and say <i>why</i> they circled both, if they like). If they have a random thought about the project, they can feel free to jot down some notes on it. Leave room on the pages for all of this, or even mark out a section that says &ldquo;your notes.&rdquo; If you can have a small photocopier in the room so people can keep a copy of their pages if they like, that will help make the point as well. 
</p>
<p>This mindset may be alien to both you and your participants, and the physical form of a sheet of questions may constrain your thought about the interaction. Allowing changes to the expected form will help shift expectations toward participation. You want people to see the form as an opportunity to reflect, not a trial to endure. You want them to create, not simply dump out, their interpretations, because in that way they will participate in sensemaking as they reflect.
</p>
<p>Why go to all this trouble? Why shift expectations toward participation? Because it will improve the catalytic material that results, which will improve the sensemaking that comes later. It will also have an impact on the return of stories to your community or organization.
