<div class="text">
<p>
When planning a project, it's a good idea to think through several important aspects of the project: its goals,
relationships, focus, range, scope, and emphasis.
Thinking about these things will make it easier to make practical decisions later, like
how and from whom you will collect stories.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Brainstorm answers to each of these questions. Write down whatever occurs to you. Don't censor
yourself. This is only your first draft. You will have a chance to refine your answers
later, after you've done some more planning activities.

Can you explain more about the planning questions and why they are useful?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>Here is an excerpt from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(pages 103-105) that explains the six questions.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Goals: Why are you doing the project?
</div>
<p>
A project’s goals seem like its most straightforward part, the part least in need of sensemaking. People who start a project know why they are doing it, right? But I’ve seen more projects fail because of misunderstandings and mismatches in goals than in any other area. Sometimes the people in a project group <em>think</em> they all understand the project’s goals, when in fact each sees a different project. At other times, people go into projects without becoming fully aware of their <em>own</em> reasons for wanting to carry them out. You need to align your visions of the project’s goals so that everyone is applying their energy to the same outcome.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Relations: Who are you in the community or organization?
</div>
<p>
A project’s relations are things like: who provides the energy for the project; who tells the stories; who works with them; who hears them; who pays for any services that take part in the project; and who provides the services. Two projects run by different groups can have drastically different outcomes even if they explore the same issues in the same community. It is important to be clear on these relations before the project starts. As you make your plans, consider how the different groups involved will react to them. The sections earlier in this chapter [Project Planning] on “Knowing your participants” (page 96) and “Considering privacy” (page 100) will be relevant in thinking about relations.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Focus: What is the project about?
</div>
<p>
A project’s focus, or center, has a lot to do with its goals; but focus is more like the “what” instead of the “why” of the project.</p>
<p>
The focus of a project can include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a topic (our community’s ten year vision)</li>
<li>a question (what is the range of views about the planned bridge?)</li>
<li>a decision (should we build a shopping center or a park?)</li>
<li>a problem (what can we do about science illiteracy?)</li>
<li>a goal (we would like to improve our services to patients)</li>
<li>a group of people (our family’s story)</li>
<li>a perspective (how new immigrants see our town)</li>
<li>a person (stories about our founder)</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you consider focus, consider any materials you have already gathered about the project, such as statements of purpose. Is anything <em>missing</em> from your consideration of focus that is in those materials? Why is that? Is it because the issue is not that important, or because it was avoided? If it was avoided, are you sure you want to avoid it? Conversely, is there anything in your materials that didn’t come up in your consideration of focus? Why do you think that happened? Should any area of your focus be investigated in greater detail? Are there sub-areas you want to investigate? Or are you trying to cover too many topics? If you have come up with a series of topics, you can rank them and cut off some of the less important ones.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Range: What will the project cover?
</div>
 
<p>All PNI projects cover a range of experience as well as focus on issues, but range is more often overlooked in project planning. The range of experience usually involves juxtaposition, or comparing things side by side. 
</p>

<p>For example, range might cover things like:
</p>
<ul>
<li> possibilities (shopping center, park, and bridge)</li>
<li> groups of people (immigrants and natives)</li>
<li> perspectives (attract business, protect the environment, preserve the past)</li>
<li> time frames (views today and views from the turn of the century)</li>
<li> locations (views from around the county)</li>
<li> goals (things we&rsquo;d like to accomplish in the next ten years)</li>
</ul>

<p>Range is not so much about why you are doing the project but what will make it succeed. For example, you aren&rsquo;t going to be able to find out what your community&rsquo;s ten year vision should be unless you include people from all parts of the community (all ages, all perspectives) and stories from the community&rsquo;s past. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Scope: How big will the project be?
</div>
 
<p>The collection of stories and other information generated by a story project should be <em>rich in meaning</em>. That does not necessarily mean it needs to be <em>large</em>. There is a tension between the sheer number of stories you collect and how many questions you can ask about each of them (and get meaningful answers). I&rsquo;ve seen story sets with fifty stories that were richer in meaning than story sets with five hundred stories in them (but in which either few questions were asked or few meaningful answers were given).
</p>
<p>As far as a minimum, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend collecting fewer than thirty stories. One hundred stories is a good number: enough to show some useful patterns and trends, but not enough to be hard to manage. When you get over three hundred stories, dealing with the volume starts to get limiting. (I write more about this issue in the section called &ldquo;How many stories to collect&ldquo; on page 132.)
</p>

<p>But this decision depends on what you will be doing with the stories. If you will be looking for patterns in them yourself, volume is a more important consideration than if you will be making them available for people to look at and talk about. It also depends on how many projects you&rsquo;ve done and what sorts of methods you&rsquo;ve worked out for processing the stories. If you&rsquo;re just starting, a nice manageable project where you ask thirty people to tell two stories each is a good idea.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Emphasis: Which PNI phases will be most prominent?
</div>
 
<p>Some PNI projects are arrayed like sunflowers, with equally sized petals, while others are like orchids, with some petals much more prominent than others. Which phases of PNI are most important to the project? Which are critical? Which are less important to success? What would happen if each phase were bigger or smaller? Which are you the most excited about, and which seem featureless?
