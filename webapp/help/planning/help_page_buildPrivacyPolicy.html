<div class="text">
<p>
On this page you can craft a statement that explains to participants
what information you will collect, how it will be used, and how they can control 
what happens to what they say.

<p>
Look at each question and think about what you want to say to people.
If you are not sure what you want to say, a good place to start is to look for
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oral+history+privacy+guidelines" target="_blank">oral history privacy guidelines</a> on the internet. 
There is plenty of good advice
on protecting anonymity and helping people feel safe to speak.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Do I need a privacy policy?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
Yes. It can be as short as one sentence, but you should definitely tell people
what you want from them and what you plan to do with it. 
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Even if the project is small and trivial?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
Yes.  
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Where should I put my privacy policy?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
If you are gathering your stories in person, you can include your privacy policy in the little canned speech you give
at the start of every interview or group session. 
If you are gathering stories over the internet, 
you can summarize your privacy policy with a single sentence at the start of your story form. 
It's a good idea to include a link to a longer explanation and some contact information for those who want more assurance.
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Is there a button that will insert my privacy policy into my NarraFirma story form?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
No, sorry. My suggestion is to click "Copy Privacy Policy," then select the text, copy it, open your story form, and paste it into the "Introduction" field.
</div>

<h3 class="question">
What if I don't yet know what I am going to do with the stories?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
Then tell people as much as you do know. 
You can say that you haven't yet decided on certain aspects of the project.
But if you do that, give people a way to contact you 
so they can find out what is going on later.
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Must I allow people to change or remove their stories?
Won't that jeopardize the project?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
Not always. Not even usually. 
On most projects most people do not feel a need to change or retract what they said.
However, if your topic is sensitive or private, or if there are big power differences 
between yourself and your participants (or your funders and your participants),
you may find that giving people the option to change their minds will help them to open up.
Remember, when people feel unsafe, they don't stop telling stories.
They just tell different, safer, more surface-level stories.
You want people to feel welcome to speak, and paradoxically, the best way to help people
feel welcome to speak is to help them feel welcome to take that speech back if they reget it later.
</div>

<h3 class="question">
But logistically speaking, such a policy might be difficult to support.
I mean, once other people have seen the stories, you can't ask them to unsee them.
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
That's true. In my experience, though people love finding out that they can change or remove
what they said, very few people actually want to do this. Dealing with one or two such requests
is not usually a big problem. Having said that, it is not unreasonable
to give people a deadline for such changes. You can say something like, "If you contact us within 30 days,
we will be happy to change or remove anything you said."
