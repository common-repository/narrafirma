In some projects, a <b>narrative intervention</b> -- an intervention in the flow of stories -- is an important part of what happens. 
What's a narrative intervention? Any action that changes the way people share stories
in the community or organization. In your project, when you collected stories, asked questions about them, 
looked for patterns in the stories and answers, and made sense of what you found, 
you might have discovered that a particular narrative intervention might help to improve conditions
in the community or organization. On this page you can plan such an intervention.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
What do the intervention types mean?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from pages 473-510) that explain the different intervention types. Note that these are <i>just some ideas</i>
for narrative interventions; this is not a definitive list of possibilities.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative ombudsmen
</div>
<p>The idea of an ombudsman or advocate as a representative of people in crisis arose thousands of years ago. Today ombudsmen in many communities and organizations help people register complaints, find help, and mediate disputes. When ombudsmen know how to listen to stories, they can help those in need feel <i>heard</i> as well as <i>helped</i>. This is especially true when people believe that &ldquo;nobody cares&rdquo; about the particular problems or people involved. In addition, an ombudsman who has been trained in listening to stories will be able to arrive at deeper understandings of problem contexts than they will if they only collect statements of fact.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative suggestion boxes
</div>
<p>Many communities and organizations already have suggestion boxes, but few use them to give people permission to talk about <i>what has happened</i> to them and what they&rsquo;d like to see happen. Making just that small change to the way in which suggestions and complaints are collected is a valid intervention in the flow of stories. Suggestion boxes, like ombudsmen, are used by people in need, and people in need <i>always</i> have stories to tell. 
</p>
<p>Using narrative suggestion boxes to listen to stories does three useful things. It opens up richer channels of communication, so that whoever is reading the suggestions can understand better what people truly need. It helps the people who are complaining or suggesting to do a little bit of sensemaking as they communicate. And it creates new stories about the nature of the community&rsquo;s response to complaints and suggestions.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Story-sharing spaces
</div>
<p>Story-sharing spaces are places in which people can tell the stories they need to tell, but <i>not</i> for the purpose of collection. In a story-sharing space, people tell stories simply <i>because they need to tell them to somebody</i>.
</p>
<p>Why should your community or organization invest in helping people tell stories if the stories won&rsquo;t be used for future projects? Because some of the needs that surface in PNI projects can never be met. Sometimes there is no fix to be found, and nothing can be done but to help people cope with the difficult situations they face. When that happens, giving people a place to share their experiences with each other provides a different kind of help than solving their problems or changing policies. The ability and permission to share stories with people who have similar problems helps people feel that they are not alone. It helps them process what has happened to them. It helps them find emotional support and internal strength. It helps them cope.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative orientations
</div>
<p>When people enter your community or organization, or when they enter into some group or activity within it, they don&rsquo;t know what to expect. Presenting people with collected stories that help them understand ground rules can help ease transitional difficulties. A narrative orientation is an effective intervention in projects where difficulty getting started with some process or in some group comes up often as a barrier.
</p>
<p>Narrative orientations don&rsquo;t have to be fancy. A sheet of paper with &ldquo;the ten stories you need to hear as you join our community&rdquo; can be as useful as a documentary with high production values. What is important is that the stories represent real experiences recounted by real people in the community or organization, not engineered fantasies of what you want people to think about the community or organization. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative learning resources
</div>
<p>A narrative learning resource is just a learning resource with real stories from real people in it. Combining how-to information with stories grounded in the reality of experience can help people get a better start on building their own bases of experience. 
</p>
<p>
This type of intervention is most useful in projects in which a lack of information or knowledge is a barrier, or when people face difficult tasks for which information may be available but questions remain. To test whether a narrative learning resource is a good intervention for your project, consider whether you heard people say anything like this in your story collection or sensemaking phases.
</p>
<ul> 
<li> I knew what I needed to do, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to put it all together.</li>
<li> If only I could sit next to somebody who has really <i>done</i> this, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d be able to pick it up. But it&rsquo;s hard starting from nothing but the facts.</li>
<li> I thought I knew how to do this already, but I learned so much from this story session!</li>
</ul> 
<p>These kinds of statements imply an excess of information combined with a lack of understanding. That last example in particular, of people expressing gratitude for what they have learned during a story collection or sensemaking session, is a sure indicator that a narrative learning resource would be a helpful intervention. When you ask people to tell you stories and they tell you how much they&rsquo;ve learned from the <i>other</i> people in the session, you&rsquo;ve found a need to learn.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative simulation
</div>
<p>This category takes participation one step further by not just telling stories but <i>immersing</i> people in them. Narrative simulation is called for when you uncover a need for the development of skills around a complex task. It is especially called for when you have found a dangerous excess of confidence around existing skills, meaning that people <i>think</i> they know how to do something but don&rsquo;t, in a way that creates danger for themselves and others.
</p>
<p>Simulations can help people learn to do complicated yet dangerous procedures in safety. Adding stories to simulation engages people in the learning task and helps them remember what they learned afterward. There is a large academic literature on the creation of narrative simulations for education and training in a variety of applications. Search for the terms &ldquo;serious play&rdquo; or &ldquo;serious games,&rdquo; the &ldquo;gamification&rdquo; of learning, and &ldquo;case-based&rdquo; or &ldquo;story-based&rdquo; simulation to find out how to create participatory narrative training experiences. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative presentations
</div>
<p>This type of intervention is about bringing selected stories from a story collection to the attention of people in the community or organization. Narrative presentations can feature stories that surfaced during sensemaking as being particularly important to the project, because they bring together important issues (pivot stories), highlight views people need to hear (voice stories), or explain things about the community or organization (discovery stories).
</p>
<p>There are many resources available for learning how to present stories to people. Here are some things to look for.</p>
<ul>
<li> Look for resources that help you tell stories <i>grounded in the reality</i> of your community or organization. </li>
<li> As you look at a resource, see if it has a section on <i>listening</i> to stories. A resource that tells you how to tell stories should also cover listening to stories so that you know which stories to tell, how to tell them, and what impacts they might have. </li>
<li> Look for resources that <i>give you things to do</i>. </li>
<li> Look for resources that <i>tell stories!</i> You need to read about the experiences people have had telling stories. </li>
</ul>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Dramatic action
</div>
<p>This type of narrative intervention is not about <i>telling</i> stories at all. It&rsquo;s about making stories happen by doing things people tell stories about. 
People make stories happen every day, in all of the things they do. A narrative intervention based on making stories happen uses this natural process to fuel positive change.
</p>
<p>When is dramatic action called for in a PNI project? When everything else isn&rsquo;t good enough. Sometimes listening to people is enough; sometimes informing or persuading people is enough; sometimes helping people work out issues is enough. But sometimes needs are uncovered for which all of these things will fall flat because the need is too great, or the layers of mistrust are too deep, to be solved by any amount of talking. Only action will do. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Spaces for sensemaking
</div>
<p>This intervention is about making everything created or collected during the first phases of your project&mdash;your planning questions, collected stories, catalytic patterns, and constructed artifacts&mdash;available to everyone in the community or organization for continued sensemaking. Just making the information available is a start, but you can go much further than that. You can actively promote continued storytelling and sensemaking after the main part of your project is over by creating a special space in which support is concentrated.
</p>
<p>When is a sensemaking space called for? That&rsquo;s a complicated question, because a sensemaking space can meet many needs. Here are just a few.
</p>
<ul> 
<li> A space for sensemaking can improve <i>transparency,</i> both in the project and in the community or organization in general, because it proves that nothing collected has been kept hidden.</li>
<li> If there wasn&rsquo;t enough <i>time</i> during a sensemaking session to address a problem or opportunity, participants can return to the sensemaking space after the session to explore the issue more on their own.</li>
<li> If <i>new issues</i> arise after the project has ended, people can return to the sensemaking space to support unanticipated sensemaking needs.</li>
<li> Groups that were poorly <i>represented</i> in the project proper (through limited planning or low participation) can visit the sensemaking space and find representation through storytelling and sensemaking after the main sensemaking phase of your project has ended. </li>
<li> A well-tended sensemaking space can form a <i>bridge</i> between projects, supporting the return phase of one project (so participants have somewhere to go to think about the last project) and the planning phase of the next (so planners have somewhere to go to think about the next project). </li>
</ul> 
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Sensemaking pyramids
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you just finished the sensemaking phase of your project. You engaged a few dozen people in lively, productive sensemaking sessions. The sessions took a while to warm up, but by the end people were ready and willing to keep going. So why not <i>help</i> people keep going? 
</p>
<p>As each sensemaking session winds down, ask if anyone in the room is interested in learning more about the process they&rsquo;ve been using. If some say yes, tell them that if they give you some contact information you&rsquo;ll send them information about the process. A few days later, contact the people who said they were interested. Give them the information you promised, which will be a brief explanation of the methods you used and why you used them, along with some pointers to resources on story work. Also ask the people if they would be willing to learn more about how to conduct sensemaking sessions like the one they participated in, so they can help the community or organization as you have done.
By spreading the word about sensemaking (and PNI), you can amplify the impact of your original project and improve the sensemaking skills of your whole community or organization. 
</p>
<p>When is a sensemaking pyramid called for? When you finish the project and wish you could start all over again, because there is just so much more out there waiting to be done. When you are surprised at how much interest you find in your sensemaking sessions. When people hang around at the end of your sessions asking questions about the methods you are using. When people envy you your role in the project, because they want to do what you&rsquo;re doing. When your collected stories show pent-up energy waiting to be released to solve problems of universal concern. When people show you that they are hungry for solutions. When people have the freedom and motivation to explore.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative mentoring
</div>
<p>Narrative mentoring is mentoring in which both participants receive instruction and support in listening to and working with stories. Instruction and support could take the form of printed instructions, training sessions, coaching, and possibly even a distinct layer of mentoring between those more and less experienced in listening to and working with stories. 
</p>
<p>When is it worthwhile to set up a narrative mentoring program? When you have discovered that people understand how to do something complex and difficult at a superficial level but not at a deep level. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative therapy
</div>
<p>In PNI there is no therapist, only a facilitator, someone like you. That&rsquo;s deliberate. It&rsquo;s to keep PNI as close to participation, and to participants, as possible. Having said that, during the intervention phase of the PNI cycle, the help of a skilled and experienced therapist may be useful. You could bring one in, or you could read enough about narrative therapy to bring some <i>elements</i> of it into your PNI work yourself.
</p>
<p>When should you consider bringing narrative therapy into your PNI project? When you have discovered an issue about which people need to start telling themselves new stories.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Participatory theatre
</div>
<p>Participatory theatre helps people work with stories to create social and political change. The methods of participatory theatre won&rsquo;t fit into <i>every</i> PNI project. PNI&rsquo;s methods may be dull in comparison, but PNI works in areas of low motivation, low interest, low trust, and high fear that participatory theatre may not be able to enter into, at least not without expert facilitation.</p>
<p>When is it worth using participatory theatre as a narrative intervention in a PNI project? In the same circumstances as with narrative therapy: when you have discovered an issue about which people need to start telling themselves new stories.
