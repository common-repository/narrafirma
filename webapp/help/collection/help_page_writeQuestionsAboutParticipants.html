		In your PNI project, you will ask three kinds of questions:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="help_page_writeStoryElicitingQuestions.html">questions that invite people to tell stories</a></li>
		<li><a href="help_page_writeQuestionsAboutStories.html">questions about the stories people tell</a></li>
		<li>questions about the people who tell the stories (which you write on this page)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		These three sets of questions combine to create a <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">story form</a>.
		</p>
<p>
Participant questions are only asked once, after people have finished telling their stories.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Add some questions to your list. For each question, write what you want to ask people about themselves. Choose what type of question it is (see the FAQ section of the page on <a href="help_page_writeQuestionsAboutStories.html">story questions</a> for an explanation of the types). Also give each question a short name (so there's room to write the question name in tables and on graphs).
</p>
<p>
You can copy questions from built-in templates (suggestions). Change the blank spaces (_____) in the question to suit your project and participants.
</p>
<p>
For help choosing, click the "Recommendations for participant questions" button. You'll see a table that shows the various options, color-coded with evaluations of risk, connected to the answers you gave to questions about your <a href="../planning/help_page_participantGroups.html">participant groups</a> and <a href="../planning/help_page_describeYourResources.html">resources</a>.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Why ask questions about participants?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The main reason to ask people questions about themselves is to look for patterns in who said what. It's almost always useful to find out that people who differ in important (but maybe not obvious) ways have had differing experiences related to a topic. Sometimes it's age, or where people live, or what kinds of things they like to do in their spare time, but there's usually something interesting to be found when you look at the stories different people tell.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
How many questions should I ask about participants?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>For a <strong>kiosk</strong> type project, in which people are just walking by and have no commitment to the project at all, you can ask <strong>three to five</strong> questions about each participant.</li>
</p><p>For a <strong>volunteer</strong> type project, in which people feel socially obligated to participate, you can ask <strong>six to nine</strong> questions about each participant.</li>
</p><p>For a <strong>commitment</strong> type project, in which people feel that participating is linked to their identities, you can ask <strong>ten to fifteen</strong> questions about each participant.</li>
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
What do the question types mean? Could you explain write-in answers? Can I use HTML formatting for questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
See the help for the <a href="help_page_writeQuestionsAboutStories.html">Writing questions about stories</a> screen.
All of these things are explained there.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
How do I set the order of the questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You don't set the question order here. You only create the questions here. You set the order of questions when you design your story form. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Beyond the obvious questions like age, what kinds of questions about people are useful?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from pages 139-140) that give some examples of questions to ask about participants.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>Basic demographic questions are things such as age, gender, income level, education, housing, marital status, children, profession, location, position, background, memberships, and so on. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Personality questions
</div>
<p>Sometimes a project needs to distinguish between participants by the way they habitually think about things. Well-known distinctions such as those posed by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and other similar systems can be useful in some projects, especially those that deal with personality issues like learning, cooperation, and dealing with challenge. For example, you may discover that introverts saw a problem as less tractable than extraverts, or that big-picture thinkers found a challenge refreshing while detail thinkers found it overwhelming. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Role questions
</div>
<p>Questions about roles ask people about their positions in the organization or community and what those positions involve. What is their position&rsquo;s scope of responsibility? What sort of thinking does it require? Do they work with people, or with numbers, or with words, or with tools? Does their work vary? Do they like their work? Are they looking around for something better? And so on. The reason to ask these questions is to look for differences in the stories people tell that link to their positions and responsibilities, which is often a source of insight. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Issue view questions
</div>
<p>Asking direct questions about views essentially embeds a non-narrative survey within a story collection.  For example, you might ask:
</p>
<ul> 
<li> Would you say the government is doing a good job?</li>
<li> Do you think our company puts customers first?</li>
<li> Do you feel like you have enough support to do the work you are asked to do?</li>
<li> How would you say that living in our town ranks among places you have lived?</li>
<li> What is your position on the corporation&rsquo;s policy towards diversity?</li>
</ul> 
<p>You might wonder: <i>If I already asked people about their views through their stories, why should I ask all over again?</i> Because asking directly about views causes people to think in a different way about the topic of your project. The combination of these two complementary approaches (direct and indirect questioning) produces a more detailed, complex picture than either approach can alone.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Community view questions
</div>
<p>Finally, you can ask direct questions about views on the community or organization. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You might ask people how they view the organization, say as a graceful dancer or a plodding mule. </li>
<li> You might ask people whether they see the community as united or in conflict, moving forward or heaping mistake upon mistake.</li>
<li> You might ask people whether they see the project itself as reaching deep to improve conditions or going through the motions and putting on a show. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you combine stated views of the community or organization with the stories people tell about it (as with views on topics), it is in the contradictions that the insights lay. If I say people in our community hate outsiders, but tell story after story about people welcoming immigrants, I have revealed to you a knot of tension that begs to be explored. It may contain an explanation, a solution, a culprit, or an opportunity.
</p>

<h3 class="question">
Can I create my own templates?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Only if you are comfortable editing the source code files in your installation of NarraFirma. If you are, find the file called "templates.js" and add your template to it. (Backup the file first!) Follow the formatting in the templates you see, and make sure you put your template in the right part of the file. If NarraFirma won't start up after you make your changes, check your browser's console to find out where the error lies.
