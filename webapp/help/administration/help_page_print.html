On this page you can print a <b>project report</b>: a record of everything you entered into the project, rendered as plain HTML. A project report
does not include any stories, but it does include every choice you made and every word you typed while you were using NarraFirma to work on the project.
A project report is a version of your project you can access after you stop using NarraFirma.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Can I open a project report in my word processor?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Maybe. The HTML document uses CSS styles, and they are included in the file (instead of referencing an external CSS file).
Some word processors can pick up CSS styles and use them as document styles. If that doesn't work, we recommend the
use of <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, which does a good job of converting HTML files 
to a variety of word processing formats, such as ODT and DOCX.

<h3 class="question">
Can I print a project report, edit it, and then import it back into NarraFirma?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. Unlike an <a href="help_page_importExport.html">exported</a> JSON file, a printed HTML project report cannot be read by NarraFirma. 
It is for your use outside the program.
