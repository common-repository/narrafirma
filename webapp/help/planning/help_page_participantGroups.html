<h1 class="page-title">Describe participant groups</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
On this page you can think about the groups of people you will be asking to share stories with you.
By thinking carefully about your participant groups now, you can lay the ground for making solid decisions 
later in the project.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
<p>
Think about groups of people whose stories you need to hear in your project. If your project is simple, you might have only 
one group. If so, you can describe that group here.
However, you might need to hear from <strong>multiple groups of people</strong> in your project. For example:
<ul>
<li>
Some people might have more authority or power than others. People in one group might defer to the other, so you need to keep them separate to they can all speak freely.
</li>
<li>
Maybe you will have two groups that don't agree. Maybe people won't want to speak in the presence of the other group.
</li>
<li>
Maybe your groups just have different backgrounds. Maybe they won't feel comfortable opening up to each other.
</li>
</ul> 
<p>
In any of those cases, create a separate description of each participant group you expect to hear from. 
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
What if I can't answer a question?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
Choose the answer "unknown." 
</div>

<h3 class="question">
What if I can't answer most of the questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
In that case, you should probably spend some more time getting to know your participant groups before you go on to the rest of 
the planning stages. Talk to people; observe people talking; ask other people who are more familiar. Then come back and
see if you are ready to describe your groups.
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Does creating separate groups on this page limit what I can do later on?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
No. The participant groups you define here only influence the recommendations you will see throughout the project.
Creeating separate groups will not stop you from including any or all of your participants in any part of your project.
