<div class="text">
<p>
On this page you can look at graphs that describe your data, make observations about them, and interpret your observations.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Start by choosing a catalysis report to work with. Then look at the patterns (graphs) NarraFirma has generated.
Click on a pattern name in the table to see it below the table. 
You can also use the arrow buttons to move systematically through the list of patterns.
</p>
<p>
As you are looking at a graph, <b>hover the mouse to see the stories</b>, thus:
<ul>
<li>In a <b>bar graph</b> (one choice question) or <b>histogram</b> (one scale question), hover over any 
bar segment to see the story there.</li>
<li>In a <b>table</b> (two choice questions), hover over an ellipse to see a list of story names.</li>
<li>In a <b>histogram table</b> (two choice questions and a scale question), 
	hover over an square to see a list of story names.</li>
<li>In a <b>scatterplot</b> (two scale questions), hover over any dot to see the story (or stories) it represents.</li>
<li>You can't hover to see stories in a <b>correlation map</b> or any of the <b>data integrity</b> graphs.
	You can hover in a correlation map to see histograms and scatterplots; but you can't hover over those graphs to see stories.
</li>

</ul>
<p>
When you are looking at any graph, <b>click and drag to select stories</b>. 
The selected stories will appear in the list under the graph. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>In a <b>bar graph</b> (one choice question) or histogram (one scale question), select one or more bars 
		by dragging through their horizontal center points.
		Where you drag vertically doesn't matter.
		You can't select parts of a bar, just the whole thing.
	</li>
	<li>In a <b>table</b> (two choice questions), 
		select any number of ellipses by dragging through their center points.</li>
	<li>In a <b>histogram table</b> (two choice questions and a scale question), 
		select any number of squares by dragging through their center points.</li>
	<li>In a <b>scatterplot</b> (two scale questions), select stories by dragging through their center points.</li>
	<li>You can't select stories in a <b>correlation map</b> or in any of the <b>data integrity</b> graphs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you think a pattern is worth noting in your report, 
mark it as remarkable using the "yes" button under the graph. Then <b>create an observation</b>
and fill it in. Be sure to give the observation a name, because it will be used as its header in your report. 
</p>
<p>
Next, <b>enter at least two
competing interpretations</b> for the observation &mdash; that is, two things reasonable people with different viewpoints might say about
what the observation means. Give each interpretation a name as well.
</p>
<p>
You can <b>sort the table of patterns</b>
by whether they have been marked as remarkable and whether you have written observations and interpretations for them.
</p>

<h2 class="heading">Tips for making the most of this page</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>This is the most complicated page in the entire NarraFirma application.
Give yourself some time to learn how to use it effectively. These tips should help
you manage the complex task of reviewing patterns and writing observations
and interpretations.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Prioritize by sorting</b>. Each of the columns in the table of patterns (at the top of the page) can be used to sort 
		the patterns generated from your data. At different times in your catalysis work you will want to use this sorting 
		function differently. Early on you might want to sort by type of graph. Later you might
		want to see which are the most statistically significant trends. After you have started to 
		write observations for your report, you will want to see which patterns you have marked and/or written about.
	</li>
	<li><b>Use the "Remarkable?" system</b>. You can mark patterns using any of five buttons (below the graph):
		<ul>
			<li><b>yes</b>: This pattern is important, and you want to write an observation and interpretations for it (or you already did).
				<i><b>You can only create new observations on patterns that have been marked as remarkable.</b></i></li>
			<li><b>no</b>: You have definitely decided not to include this pattern in your report.</li>
			<li><b>maybe</b>: You might want to include this pattern, and you've marked it to check again later or discuss
				with your team. You will probably be changing the "maybe" status later on.</li>
			<li><b>redundant</b>: This pattern is important, but it is similar to another pattern you have 
				written an observation and interpretations for, so you are not going to include it in the report.
				You might want to add a non-printing note to this observation so you know which observation it is redundant with.
				You might also want to include its name and/or graph in the pattern you wrote the observation for.</li>
			<li><b>unmarked</b>: This pattern has not yet been reviewed. You can "unmark" a pattern after you have marked it,
				perhaps because you think it should be looked at again, or something.</li>
		</ul>
		The marking system has no effect on printing the report. Observations (and interpretations) are printed
		if they have either a name or a text, and if their strength value matches the values you chose when printing the report.
		You can also hide individual observations and/or interpretations from the report by hiding them on the 
		<a href="help_page_clusterInterpretations.html">clustering page</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Start with the simpler patterns</b>. It can help to look at your patterns one type at a time. For example, you might start by 
		looking only at the "data integrity" graphs, to see if there are any systematic biases 
		in the answers people gave to questions. Then you might look at the bar graphs and histograms (which are simple)
		before moving on to the more complex interactions among questions. If a type of graph 
		is not being shown on this page, it doesn't mean you have lost any observations you wrote about 
		those graphs; you will see them again when you view that type of graph again.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Eliminate questions that didn't work</b>. It often happens that one or two questions do not result in any useful patterns. 
		The question didn't make sense to people, or it didn't apply to their stories,
		or (most often) there was little variation in the responses.
		Once you are sure that a question is not worth considering, you can 
		uncheck its checkbox on the <a href="help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">Configure catalysis report</a> page.
		This will reduce the number of patterns generated and streamline your task.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Use observation strengths to triage</b>. 
		You can use the "strength" question about each observation to create a triage system for writing your 
		catalysis report. As you write your observations, give each one a strength value.
		Create a consistent system, like this one:
		<ul><li>
			To be marked as strong, a pattern must be both obvious and surprising to everyone who sees it.</li>
			<li>
				To be marked as medium, a pattern should be difficult (but not impossible) to dispute, and at least moderately interesting.</li>
			</li>
			<li>
				To be marked as weak, a pattern should be either easy to dispute (the numbers are small, 
				the relationship is murky) or not meaningful (perhaps it's a foregone conclusion).
			</li>
		</ul>
		Once you have finished writing your observations, 
		you can sort your patterns list by observation strength, and write 
		interpretations only for the observations marked strongest. 
	</li>
	<li><b>Give everything a name</b>. Make sure all of your observations and interpretations have clear, brief names. They are used as headers in
		the printed report. 
	</li>
</ul>

			<td valign="top" class="noborders">A <b>data integrity</b> graph is a special kind of graph specifically for checking to make sure

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="stattests">What statistical tests are being reported?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
<li>
For a contingency table (two choice questions), the statistic is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test">chi-squared test</a>.</li>
<li>For multiple histograms with mutually exclusive choices, 
the test is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Mann-Whitney U test</a> 
for differences between means. (The lowest significance level for any pair of subsets is reported.)</li>
<li>
For scatter plots, the test is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman's ranked correlation coefficient</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's test are used without testing whether
the data is normally distributed, to be conservative.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
		<a id="hidestattests">Can I hide the statistical results?</a>
	</h3>
	<div class="question-answer">
	<p>Yes. 
		Go to the "Configure catalysis report" page and uncheck the check box under "Would you prefer to hide statistical results on the Explore Patterns page?"
		Then come back to the "Explore Patterns" page and look at your graphs again; they will not show any statistical results.
		You can still see the statistical results by choosing "Show statistical results" in the "things you can do" list and clicking 'Do it.'
	</p><p>
		Note: when you hide statistical results, the HTML elements (divs) that show the statistical results are actually still on the page. 
		They just have their "display" options set to "none". If you wanted to temporarily show a statistical-results panel (maybe for a screenshot or something), 
		you could open your browser's development console, inspect the graph whose panel you want to show, find the hidden statistical panel, and turn off its "display: none" option.

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="skewnesskurtosis">What is skewness? What is kurtosis?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	Skewness is a measure of how far the distribution is skewed away from being symmetrical. 
	Positive skewness means the bulk of the values are on the left (and the right tail is longer). 
	Negative skewness means the bulk of the values are on the right (and the left tail is longer).
</p>
<img src="help_skewness.png" width="200">
<p>Kurtosis is a measure of how peaked or flat a distribution is.
	Positive kurtosis means the distribution is strongly peaked.
	Negative kurtosis means the distribution is flattened. 
</p>
<img src="help_kurtosis.png" width="200">
</div>

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="notmutuallyexclusive">Why do some of the table rows say "None (choices not mutually exclusive)"?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
That's because some of the tests (chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U) can only be run on mutually exclusive choices. 
Any questions where people could choose more than one answer will have no test values when they 
are combined with other questions.
</p>
</div>
		
<h3 class="question">
	<a id="formattexts">How can I format the texts in my observations and interpretations?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can control the formatting of your observation and interpretation texts in three ways. 
</p>
<ol>
		<li>You can use these simple markup tags: **bold** and __italic__.</li>
	<li>You can use these HTML tags: 
		address, article, b, 
		big, blockquote, br, caption, cite, code, del, dd, d1, dt, em, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, 
		hr, i, kbd, li, ol, p, pre, s, small, sup, sub, strong, strike, table, td, th, tr, u, ul.

	<li>You can use custom CSS. See the help page on <a href="help_page_printCatalysisReport.html">Printing the catalysis report</a> for an explanation.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="saveselection">Can I save the list of stories I'm looking at under a graph?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	Yes you can.
If you have made a selection of stories in one part of a graph (say in the upper right corner of a
scatter plot), you might want to remember those stories when you look back at your observation
again. Under the graph, choose "Save the current selection," then click "Do it." A text representation of what you selected 
will appear in the "These are the selections you have saved" text box. 
</p>
<p>
When you return to the observation again and want to see the same stories, 
click inside the text representation of the selection in the "These are the selections you have saved" text box.
Then choose "Restore a saved selection" and click "Do it."" 
The same stories should appear in the list. 
</p>
<p>
You can record and use more than one selection, and you can
(carefully) edit the text representations by hand, if you want to.

			When NarraFirma prints your report, it will print the additional patterns you specified just after the pattern

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="deletedobservation">Help! I deleted an observation, but I didn't mean to, and now the interpretations
I wrote under it are also gone. Can I get it (and them) back?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you deleted only the name and text of an observation, you can get the interpretations back.
Just write a new observation name and/or text, and your interpretations will reappear.
</p>
<p>
	However, if you deleted the entire observation using the minus button (-) under the graph, you can't get your interpretations back.
	Only delete observations using the minus button if you are sure you don't want to keep the interpretations.
</p>
<p>Having said that, there is a way to find interpretation texts you lost, even if you have deleted the whole observation.
	Go to the Project management page and export your entire project history.
	Then open the JSON file in a text editor and search on some text you remember being in the lost interpretations.

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="changestories">I've got some observations written, but I've suddenly realized that I have to change something about my stories.
Do I have to start all over again?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you need to change your stories but do not need to create a new story collection, you can just go ahead and
change your stories. Be sure to go back over your observations to see if you need to revise them.
</p>
<p>
	If you need to start a new story collection, perhaps because you discovered an import mistake, you can still fix the problem. 
	Scroll to the bottom of
	the "Configure catalysis report" page, and click "Export report elements to CSV." This will write out a CSV file
	with all of the observations, interpretations, and perspectives you have created in the report.
	Then create your new story collection, create a new catalyis report, scroll down to the bottom of 
	the "Configure catalysis report" page again, and click "Import report elements from CSV." As long as the 
	question short names match between the two story collections (or both sets of story collections), 
	the report elements will connect up correctly. There is a fuller explanation of this feature 
	in the help page for the <a href="help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">Configure catalysis report</a> page.

Yes there is. You can use display lumping, which is explained in the help for the <a href="help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">Configure catalysis report</a> page.

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="linkingquestions">What are linking questions for?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
	<p>Linking questions help readers of your catalysis report understand <strong>how each observation is connected to its interpretations</strong>. 
		They do this by framing a question to which your interpretations are answers.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In a perspectives (clustered-interpretations) report, an observation's linking question is printed just before each of its interpretations.
			In this case, the question serves as a quick summary of the observation that helps people understand what the interpretation refers to.
		</li>
		<li>In a themes (clustered-observations) report, an observation's linking question is printed between the observation and its interpretations.
			In this case, the question is less a summary than an introduction to the array of answers represented by the interpretations.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Without linking questions, you might end up starting each interpretation with the same question. Writing linking questions
		saves you that bother, and it makes your report more clear.

<h3 class="question">
		<a id="interpparts">Why does an interpretation have a main text plus an idea and questions? What should I write there?</a>
	</h3>
	<div class="question-answer">
		<p>The interpretation's <b>main text</b> is exactly that, an interpretation of the observation, a viewpoint on what it means.
			It is an explanation of the observation from a particular perspective.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interpretation <b>questions</b> are things people might want to ponder and discuss as they consider the interpretation. Some example questions might be:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who might agree with this interpretation of this pattern? Who might not?</li>
				<li>What does this mean about ____?</li>
				<li>What could lead to this?</li>
				<li>Should we ___? Why? Why not?</li>
				<li>How might we learn more about this?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
				An <b>idea</b> is a thing somebody could <i>do</i> based on that interpretation. It's a suggestion for improvement,
				and its goal is to get people thinking about possibilities.

<h3 class="question">
	<a id="competing">Why should I write two competing interpretations for each observation?</a>
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Here is an excerpt from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from page 272) that can explains why writing competing interpretations
is worth doing.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>
My placement of the generation of multiple interpretations at the center of catalysis is 
based on my observations of how people react to single interpretations of patterns. When people encounter 
one interpretation, you can see them taking sides: do I agree or don’t I? Their attention 
is on the interpretation, not on their own feelings or beliefs or experiences. They put on their armor 
and prepare to do battle. It’s clear to them that the one interpretation they see is the interpretation 
held by the author of the report: why else would they write it? And as the interpretations build 
throughout the report, people build explanations about the whole report: it’s biased, 
or the author doesn’t know what they are talking about, or the reasoning is flawed. All
of this stops sensemaking short and destroys any hope of productive thought or discussion.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, when you give people two or more <em>competing</em> interpretations of the same pattern, 
they turn their attention away from attacking or defending the interpretations and toward 
<em>exploring their own experiences</em>. This is what you want people to do. You want people to dwell 
on messy ambiguities, and to use them, until they resolve themselves naturally (or don’t). If the 
author of the report has written two interpretations, the reader <em>can’t</em> tell which is the 
author’s own, so there is nothing to attack or defend, and there are no larger explanations about 
bias or ineptitude to build. The report author essentially walks out of the picture 
and lets the reader think. The reader can put away their armor and get out their maps 
and spyglasses. They can explore.
</p>
<p>
Let me give you a more concrete example of how this works. Say I am looking at stories people 
told about their telephone service. Say I’ve seen a pattern that the younger the participant, 
the more likely they were to say they felt disappointed by the events in their story. If I give people 
one interpretation &mdash; that younger people are not happy with their telephone service &mdash; people start 
turning their binary switches off and on. Yes that’s right, no that’s wrong. But what happens if I say 
that younger people might not be happy with their telephone service, or older people might not 
understand the question, or younger people might be more willing to admit to disappointment 
(whereas older people might feel more pressure to say everything’s fine), or younger people 
might be more disappointed about other things and it drifts over, and so on? I’ve marked out a space 
for exploration and invited people on a journey, instead of setting up a straw man to be knocked down.
