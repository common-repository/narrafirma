<p>
There are many ways to collect stories. Some work best in certain situations, and some work best in others. 
To succeed in your goals, it's important to think carefully about how you will collect stories. 
For example, don't consider only one way because it's the easiest way. 
If you base your decision solely on what's easiest, you could end up with a project that goes nowhere &mdash; and that's not easy, is it?
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Think about the participant groups you will be asking to tell stories, and think about how they can best be approached. 
In some projects you will need to approach people differently due to differences in free time, confidence, power, and other 
characteristics that influence their responses to the various ways of collecting stories. 
You might only need one story collection method, or you might need two or three.
</p>
<p>
For each method you decide to use, think about whom you will include, how and when and where you will record stories, and other details. 
</p>
<p>
For help choosing, click the "Method recommendations" button. You'll see a table that shows the various options, 
color-coded with evaluations of risk, connected to the answers you gave to questions about 
your <a href="../planning/help_page_participantGroups.html">participant groups</a> and <a href="../planning/help_page_describeYourResources.html">resources</a>.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
I don't understand the various collection methods. Can you explain them?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from pages 109-121) that explain the different collection methods.
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">
One-on-one expert interviews
</div>
<p>
<p>A one-on-one expert interview is an interview of one person conducted by one other person who knows a lot about stories or about the subject matter being explored in the interview.
</p>
<p>There are some specific situations where an expert interview is either required or recommended to ensure the quality of the stories collected. A one-on-one interview may be best when the topic is so private or sensitive that a person can only speak in a private session with a person for whom they have already built up trust, such as a doctor, therapist, or minister. Also, a one-on-one interview may be best when the interviewee is so busy or used to authority that they cannot (or will not) find the time to participate unless the interview has the status of being conducted by an expert. One would not, for example, be likely to ask the highest official in a country to attend group or peer interviews.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Group interviews
</div>
<p>
A group interview is an expert interview in which more than one person is interviewed at once. Typically a script of some kind is followed, though the best interviewers will be able to adapt the interview to the conditions they find. 
</p>
<p>As with peer interviews and group sessions, people in group interviews remind each other of experiences. But unlike those methods, group interviews are strongly controlled by the central interviewer, who is usually expert in the subject matter or in story work.
The best time to use group interviews is when you want the mutual prompting created as people listen to each other telling stories, but you need to remain engaged in the conversation to keep it moving and in the right direction. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Peer interviews
</div>
<p>Peer interviews are those in which the people who are being asked to tell stories interview each other. 
This drawing out is especially useful when your project involves long experience, such as with people remembering their careers. It is also helpful when you are an outsider and people will self-censor when speaking to you. For example, say you want to gather stories from two ethnic groups who grudgingly share a city block. In this case your project is more likely to succeed if you start with peer interviews within each group than if you attempt a group story session or expert interviews.
</p>
<p>However, peer interviews do have some limitations. Peer interviewers may avoid issues they know to be taboo, and they may leave unsaid things &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; knows. So while peer interviews improve the depth to which memory and articulation penetrate, they place limits on the range of experience covered. If experience is a landscape, peer interviews drill deep but stay close to home. For some projects this may be just what you need; but for others it may be best to complement peer interviews with another method that increases the range of experience, such as an anonymous survey submitted via telephone, computer, or paper.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Group story sessions
</div>
<p>While a group interviewer engages with the group in conversation, a group story session facilitator provides <i>tasks</i> for groups to complete. If you picture the meeting as a stream, a group interviewer swims <i>in</i> the stream with the interviewees, but a session facilitator stands on the bank, dipping into the stream only occasionally to test the waters. The momentum of the stream comes from the participants, not the facilitator. In fact, the facilitator of a group session may not even be present in the room; they might be represented only by a set of instructions on paper.
</p>
<p>I have consistently found stories collected in group sessions to provide superior &ldquo;food for thought&rdquo; for sensemaking than stories collected in any other way. When you can get people into the flow of group story exchange, things happen that just don&rsquo;t happen in other settings. People open up and reveal feelings, beliefs, and perspectives that strike deep into the heart of the issues being explored.
</p>
<p>However, group story sessions have fairly high requirements in practice. I guess you could say they are high input and high output. They can by physically difficult to set up, since people need to be able to come together into one room. Even the type of room has to be just right; an auditorium or classroom, for example, won&rsquo;t work because people need to be able to move around in small groups. Group sessions require a certain amount of motivation on the part of participants, since people are being asked to do more than respond to simple cues. They require a freedom to speak freely that excludes the most and least powerful in most societies. Group sessions also require more facilitation expertise than scripted peer interviews, though less than expert or group interviews. Specifically, they require the ability to guide participation without taking charge of it, and this is not something everyone can do.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Surveys
</div>
<p>In a narrative survey, people tell their stories without direct human contact. This can be done through a telephone, a piece of paper, a web form, a software interface or an email. But no matter the medium, the interaction in a survey is a distant, one-way communication, more like a message in a bottle than a conversation. 
</p>
<p>Surveys have their good points and bad points. On the good side, a survey is easy to administer. There is no need to gather people in a room and keep them interested in staying there; just send out a survey and hope some percentage of its recipients respond. You can reach far more people, and more diverse groups, with a survey than you can gather in a room. You don&rsquo;t need a travel budget, just an address. If your expected population of participants is large, diverse, widespread, or busy, or if your resources are very small, a survey may be the only realistic way you can collect stories at all. 
</p>
<p>On the bad side, a survey is as easy to ignore as it is to administer. Unless your community or organization is exceptionally cooperative, the minority of recipients who do respond will not be a random subset of the population. Even to get that small percentage you might have to pay people or force them to comply, and that would distort your story collection as well. Because there is no human face behind it, a survey is easy to laugh at, game, rush through thoughtlessly, half-complete, or even subvert. No matter how well prepared your earnest explanations of your goals, you have no control over whether people will read them or pass over them. I have seen survey story collections where up to a quarter of those who filled out the survey in the first place (a small fraction of those asked) completed the survey without actually telling any stories. That&rsquo;s slim pickings. So if you want to collect stories with a survey, make sure you know <em>why</em> the choice is worth making.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Journals
</div>
<p>Journal-based story collection is a lot like surveying, but instead of asking people to tell you stories once, you ask them to tell you stories every so often, for example daily for a month or weekly for a year. You can also ask people to fill out a journal entry whenever they think of it, usually when something significant has just happened. 
</p>
<p>Collecting stories via journaling is most useful when you want to get an in-depth look at what people are thinking and feeling as things happen to them in their daily lives. It&rsquo;s not the best method to use if you want people to look back over a long period of time, but it&rsquo;s an excellent focuser on things as they are right now. If you need people to bounce stories off each other, this is also not the best method to use, because it is an individual method of story collection. However, journaling is useful if you need people to look inside their emotions and practices, because it&rsquo;s a private, reflective activity. It&rsquo;s also useful if your topic is so sensitive that people won&rsquo;t be able to reveal their true feelings in a group.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative incident reports
</div>
<p>In most methods of story collection, you ask people to recall stories about events that have happened to them or that they have heard about from others. In this method, you don&rsquo;t ask people to recall stories. You ask people to <i>watch stories happen</i>.  
</p>
<p>Narrative incident reports can be collected by watching people in a variety of situations: eating at sidewalk caf&eacute;s, making appointments at doctors&rsquo; offices, browsing in supermarkets, waiting at airports, and so on. Anywhere people can be observed without compromising their privacy &mdash; that is, any public place &mdash; is a legitimate place to collect narrative incident reports. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Gleaned stories
</div>
<p>There is one circumstance in which I believe it is legitimate to observe storytelling without the participation of the storytellers (and still call it PNI), and that is when the stories were told before you got there. Sometimes you may not be able to ask people to tell stories about a particular topic, but you do have access to records of their conversations made beforehand, possibly for some other reason. For example, say you have discovered in the archives division of your corporation a repository of thousands of discussions stretching back decades. Such a treasure trove of stories could provide valuable sensemaking material to a project bridging the past and future of the organization. I do consider it participatory to make use of such material when it is available, though it is better used as a <i>complement</i> to teller-interpreted stories than as a replacement for them.
